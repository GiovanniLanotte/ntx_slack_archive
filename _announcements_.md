 >do you have a notification service for server outages going yet?

 **amine.abdessemed** :

 ><@U302S61V5> we are running the bot on a managed server, server outages are uncommon and handled in seconds thanks to our partners BeepboopHQ . Archiving is currently active and stored to <https://github.com/NeuroTechX/ntx_slack_archive/tree/master> 

> 
For now, some messages are being ignored due to some bad sync with Github. The dev version of the bot I'm working on fixes this issue and will be deployed this week.

 ><!channel> We need help!

> 
The Student Clubs committee is looking for someone to help us develop a website for the Student Clubs initiative. The website will be cool and good-looking, including lots of ressources for new, future and established student clubs, obviously open-source, and probably developed using Jekyll (or similar framework) on GitHub. If you know someone that would be interested in helping us, please contact me (<mailto:benjamindeleener@neurotechx.com|benjamindeleener@neurotechx.com>).
