 **sydneyneurotechx** :

 ><!channel>  I would like to thank our partner at BeepBoopHQ for sponsoring NeuroTechX with free bot support. This sponsorship will allow for us to expand our services that we can create for NeuroBotX, so that you can get the most out of Slack. All hail our new bot overlords! To learn more about BeepBoopHQ, please visit their website: <https://beepboophq.com/>

 ><@U08SY292B>: does this mean that past messages will not be erased anymore?

2/27/2017 3:22 PM

 >do you have a notification service for server outages going yet?

2/28/2017 2:13 PM

 **amine.abdessemed** :

 ><@U302S61V5> we are running the bot on a managed server, server outages are uncommon and handled in seconds thanks to our partners BeepboopHQ . Archiving is currently active and stored to <https://github.com/NeuroTechX/ntx_slack_archive/tree/master> 

> 
For now, some messages are being ignored due to some bad sync with Github. The dev version of the bot I'm working on fixes this issue and will be deployed this week.

 ><!channel> We need help!

> 
The Student Clubs committee is looking for someone to help us develop a website for the Student Clubs initiative. The website will be cool and good-looking, including lots of ressources for new, future and established student clubs, obviously open-source, and probably developed using Jekyll (or similar framework) on GitHub. If you know someone that would be interested in helping us, please contact me (<mailto:benjamindeleener@neurotechx.com|benjamindeleener@neurotechx.com>).

 >Hey everyone, big news: Mindsets Kickstarter goes live tomorrow morning at 8am EST!

> 
For those of you who arent familiar, Mindset is a pair of overear headphones that integrate EEG sensors into the band to measure and improve concentration. Theyre bluetooth, noise cancelling, and give you full access to the data. You can get more info at <http://thinkmindset.com|thinkmindset.com>, which will also redirect to the Kickstarter once its up.

> 
The campaign goes live tomorrow at 8am EST. Be the first to grab one of the early birds, and get 46% off! :smile:

 >moia tried out unwind and its very cool! Ive been using <http://brain.fm|brain.fm> for a couple years now with their focus, relaxation and sleep sessions. Unwinds heartrate feature makes it unique though and I like that. The music was also very calming and the 5 minute session is nice if I just want to take a quick break from the flow of things during my day. Will share and spread the music!

 >Call for speakers -- O'Reilly Artificial Intelligence Conference in San Francisco

> 


> 
The OReilly AI Conference is coming to San Francisco September 17-20, 2017 to explore the most essential and intriguing topics in intelligence engineering and applied AI. Were looking for compelling case studies, technical sessions, tear-downs of both successful and failed AI projects, technical and organizational best practices, and more. Apply to speak by March 28.

 **sydneyneurotechx** :

 ><!channel>  I would to announce NeuroTechX's  new initiative, the "Mother of all BCI Benchmark" project. 

> 


> 
The Goal of this project is to build a comprehensive benchmark of popular BCI algorithms applied on an extensive list of freely available EEG dataset. The code will be made available on github, serving as a reference point for the future algorithmic developments. Algorithms can be ranked and promoted on a website, providing a clear picture of the different solutions available in the field.

> 


> 
Reproducible Research in BCI has a long way to go. While many BCI datasets are made freely available, researchers do not publish code, and reproducing results required to benchmark new algorithms turns out to be more tricky than it should be. Performances can be significantly impacted by parameters of the preprocessing steps, toolboxes used and implementation tricks that are almost never reported in the literature. As a results, there is no comprehensive benchmark of BCI algorithm, and newcomers are spending a tremendous amount of time browsing literature to find out what algorithm works best and on which dataset.

> 


> 


> 
alexandre.barachant will lead the initiative and I will provide logistic support to push it forward. This will be mostly a coding project (It will be open source, so anyone can contribute), however people with a design background are invited as well.

> 


> 
If you are interested in participating, please fill out the doodle below. We will arrange one or two calls based on everyones availability.

 >===============================================

> 
Hey everyone (<!channel>),

> 
As you might know, NeuroTechX is currently trying to see how it could help people find opportunities in the field of NeuroTechnology and to help find good candidates for those looking for talent. 

> 
(from industry to academia, from small teams to larger corporations)

> 
As NeuroTechX grows, more and more people are asking us for opportunities often thinking that there are not many opportunities in neurotechnology. At the same time, we have research labs and companies of all sizes reaching out looking for talent. NeuroTechX is therefore in a good position to help this match-making.

> 
If you are currently in the field or would like to find opportunities in the field or intend to work in the field later, then you want to check this out:

> 
<http://bit.ly/ntx-recruitment-slack|bit.ly/ntx-recruitment-slack>

> 
If you dont care about neurotechnology and are not looking for contributing to the field, then indeed you can skip it. 

> 
(and also second guess what you are doing here :p)

 >May I please request your help in getting yannick nominated for a world class TED talk? This one requires a team effort to make happen :ntx:

I believe that if he had the chance to present our community to TEDs audience, the quality of NTX will solidly increase as passionate people are inspired to join NeuroTechX.
