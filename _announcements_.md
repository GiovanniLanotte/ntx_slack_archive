2/28/2017 2:13 PM

 **amine.abdessemed** :

 ><@U302S61V5> we are running the bot on a managed server, server outages are uncommon and handled in seconds thanks to our partners BeepboopHQ . Archiving is currently active and stored to <https://github.com/NeuroTechX/ntx_slack_archive/tree/master> 

> 
For now, some messages are being ignored due to some bad sync with Github. The dev version of the bot I'm working on fixes this issue and will be deployed this week.

 ><!channel> We need help!

> 
The Student Clubs committee is looking for someone to help us develop a website for the Student Clubs initiative. The website will be cool and good-looking, including lots of ressources for new, future and established student clubs, obviously open-source, and probably developed using Jekyll (or similar framework) on GitHub. If you know someone that would be interested in helping us, please contact me (<mailto:benjamindeleener@neurotechx.com|benjamindeleener@neurotechx.com>).

 >Hey everyone, big news: Mindsets Kickstarter goes live tomorrow morning at 8am EST!

> 
For those of you who arent familiar, Mindset is a pair of overear headphones that integrate EEG sensors into the band to measure and improve concentration. Theyre bluetooth, noise cancelling, and give you full access to the data. You can get more info at <http://thinkmindset.com|thinkmindset.com>, which will also redirect to the Kickstarter once its up.

> 
The campaign goes live tomorrow at 8am EST. Be the first to grab one of the early birds, and get 46% off! :smile:

 >moia tried out unwind and its very cool! Ive been using <http://brain.fm|brain.fm> for a couple years now with their focus, relaxation and sleep sessions. Unwinds heartrate feature makes it unique though and I like that. The music was also very calming and the 5 minute session is nice if I just want to take a quick break from the flow of things during my day. Will share and spread the music!

 **sydneyneurotechx** :

 ><!channel>  I would to announce NeuroTechX's  new initiative, the "Mother of all BCI Benchmark" project. 

> 


> 
The Goal of this project is to build a comprehensive benchmark of popular BCI algorithms applied on an extensive list of freely available EEG dataset. The code will be made available on github, serving as a reference point for the future algorithmic developments. Algorithms can be ranked and promoted on a website, providing a clear picture of the different solutions available in the field.

> 


> 
Reproducible Research in BCI has a long way to go. While many BCI datasets are made freely available, researchers do not publish code, and reproducing results required to benchmark new algorithms turns out to be more tricky than it should be. Performances can be significantly impacted by parameters of the preprocessing steps, toolboxes used and implementation tricks that are almost never reported in the literature. As a results, there is no comprehensive benchmark of BCI algorithm, and newcomers are spending a tremendous amount of time browsing literature to find out what algorithm works best and on which dataset.

> 


> 


> 
alexandre.barachant will lead the initiative and I will provide logistic support to push it forward. This will be mostly a coding project (It will be open source, so anyone can contribute), however people with a design background are invited as well.

> 


> 
If you are interested in participating, please fill out the doodle below. We will arrange one or two calls based on everyones availability.

 >===============================================

Hey everyone (<!channel>),

> 
As you might know, NeuroTechX is currently trying to see how it could help people find opportunities in the field of NeuroTechnology and to help find good candidates for those looking for talent. 

> 
(from industry to academia, from small teams to larger corporations)

> 
As NeuroTechX grows, more and more people are asking us for opportunities often thinking that there are not many opportunities in neurotechnology. At the same time, we have research labs and companies of all sizes reaching out looking for talent. NeuroTechX is therefore in a good position to help this match-making.

> 
If you are currently in the field or would like to find opportunities in the field or intend to work in the field later, then you want to check this out:

> 
<http://bit.ly/ntx-recruitment-slack|bit.ly/ntx-recruitment-slack>

> 
If you dont care about neurotechnology and are not looking for contributing to the field, then indeed you can skip it. 

> 
(and also second guess what you are doing here :p)

_NeuroTechVan Fireside_ brings in world class speakers to present ideas in world of brain computer interfaces.  

> 


> 
On June the 25th, globally acclaimed theoretical physicist Dr. Cisco Gooding will help our members bridge the gap between neuroscience and cutting edge quantum research. Gooding provides an authoritative perspective of orchestrated objective reduction(OR-ORCH) and warm quantum coherence in biological systems. In addition to his various academic publications in theoretical physics Gooding is notably a research colleague of Roger Penrose, father of "OR-ORCH" theory.

> 


> 
We invite you to attend the live stream of the event where you can ask us questions real time via twitter. Details and link to be posted shortly. 

> 


> 
This will be a connection of the two revolutionary fields in our modern day: Quantum Physics and Neuroscience. 

> 


> 
If you are in Vancouver, come hang out with us in person! We will go for beer and chicken waffles to causally catalyze networking after the event.

6/9/2017 11:50 AM

 >So I signed up and will be there. Thanks. Going to try and have the whole physics team there actually. Yep

6/9/2017 3:37 PM

 **dano** :

 >a.tech: Hey you know Cisco! He's a pretty good guy

6/9/2017 4:25 PM

 **stephen** :

 >a.tech Since this can be a controversial topic, it would be helpful for you to describe more specifics about what the speaker will present, what the speaker _wont_ present (i.e. a reiteration of Penroses theories?), and the types of questions / conversations that would be constructive for attendees to bring up.

6/9/2017 4:26 PM

 **jnaulty** :

 >Quantum Physics + Neuroscience :smile:

6/9/2017 4:40 PM

 **stephen** :

 >Also, for a globally acclaimed physicist, its odd that he only has 18 citations. <https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Cisco_Gooding>

> 


> 
Its definitely possible to have a constructive conversation about quantum physics + neuroscience. You might have a few speakers representing different perspectives or interpretations. Perhaps one could play the skeptic, one could be the voice of Penrose, and one could say I land in the middle in these ways or it depends on doing these experiments that we dont yet have the tools to do. 

> 


> 
As it stands, this event doesnt seem to appreciate those nuances. I advise a policy where we call things for what they are. 

> 


> 
*To be totally clear: this smells like bullshit and seems highly inconsistent with the otherwise scientifically-credible brand of NeurotechX.*

> 


> 
Do others have thoughts on this?

6/9/2017 4:44 PM

 **mhough** :

 >yes, I agree I just didn't know we were having this conversation.

6/9/2017 4:48 PM

 **mhough** :

 >I can bring people, again I thought it a little out of topic but if you want to put a team together for the Penrose Prize there are people interested. I will not tolerate BS and I want it much clearer what constitutes evidence

6/9/2017 4:50 PM

 **mhough** :

 >Karl Pribram really was friends with some of these guys and would talk about it a lot more than I thought practical

6/9/2017 4:53 PM

 **mhough** :

 >But you have to get ready for the maths no matter what

6/9/2017 4:58 PM

 **mhough** :

 >How are we going to navigate in an algorithmic world populated with quantum algorithms without being comfortable navigating this from a position of knowledge

6/9/2017 5:02 PM

 **mhough** :

 >I just want someone from the Bohm/Penrose/I don't know who else to tell me what they need or are waiting for. Microtubules something was the answer I always got maybe 20 years ago

6/9/2017 5:02 PM

 **bryan_j** :

 >^ lol

6/9/2017 5:03 PM

 **stephen** :

 >a.tech mhough At the least, you could say at the top of the event page We acknowledge this is a controversial topic among neuroscientists and Dr. Gooding will make invest sufficient time in (1) outlining the specific claims he wants to make and (2) acknowledging and addressing the common objections to discussions and quantum physics and neuroscience.

> 


> 
So that the event is less of an unquestioned endorsement

6/9/2017 5:04 PM

 **stephen** :

 >What do you think about that?

6/9/2017 5:04 PM

 **mhough** :

 >This is like Lyme's disease in a way. Anywhere a mystery lies people project

6/9/2017 5:04 PM

 **mhough** :

 >We know a lot more about microtubules now

6/9/2017 5:06 PM

 **stephen** :

 >mhough Regardless of what we know about microtubules, it needs to be the case that people looking at the event page (even if they dont attend the event) see that the framing of the event was sound, and that there wasnt an unquestioned endorsement of the speaker.

6/9/2017 5:07 PM

 **stephen** :

 >This is just what you do if you want to navigate controversial territory. You put ten times the usual effort into framing the conversation in a way that retains credibility for the hosting organization.

6/9/2017 5:07 PM

 **mhough** :

 >Oh yeah, no thats all you guys. Sorry, I hope you don't think I was really weighing in on that
