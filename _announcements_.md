The Student Clubs committee is looking for someone to help us develop a website for the Student Clubs initiative. The website will be cool and good-looking, including lots of ressources for new, future and established student clubs, obviously open-source, and probably developed using Jekyll (or similar framework) on GitHub. If you know someone that would be interested in helping us, please contact me (<mailto:benjamindeleener@neurotechx.com|benjamindeleener@neurotechx.com>).

Unwinds heartrate feature makes it unique though and I like that. The music was also very calming and the 5 minute session is nice if I just want to take a quick break from the flow of things during my day. Will share and spread the music!

 **sydneyneurotechx** :

 ><!channel>  I would to announce NeuroTechX's  new initiative, the "Mother of all BCI Benchmark" project. 

> 


> 
The Goal of this project is to build a comprehensive benchmark of popular BCI algorithms applied on an extensive list of freely available EEG dataset. The code will be made available on github, serving as a reference point for the future algorithmic developments. Algorithms can be ranked and promoted on a website, providing a clear picture of the different solutions available in the field.

> 


> 
Reproducible Research in BCI has a long way to go. While many BCI datasets are made freely available, researchers do not publish code, and reproducing results required to benchmark new algorithms turns out to be more tricky than it should be. Performances can be significantly impacted by parameters of the preprocessing steps, toolboxes used and implementation tricks that are almost never reported in the literature. As a results, there is no comprehensive benchmark of BCI algorithm, and newcomers are spending a tremendous amount of time browsing literature to find out what algorithm works best and on which dataset.

> 


> 


> 
alexandre.barachant will lead the initiative and I will provide logistic support to push it forward. This will be mostly a coding project (It will be open source, so anyone can contribute), however people with a design background are invited as well.

> 


> 
If you are interested in participating, please fill out the doodle below. We will arrange one or two calls based on everyones availability.

 >===============================================

> 
Hey everyone (<!channel>),

> 
As you might know, NeuroTechX is currently trying to see how it could help people find opportunities in the field of NeuroTechnology and to help find good candidates for those looking for talent. 

> 
(from industry to academia, from small teams to larger corporations)

> 
As NeuroTechX grows, more and more people are asking us for opportunities often thinking that there are not many opportunities in neurotechnology. At the same time, we have research labs and companies of all sizes reaching out looking for talent. NeuroTechX is therefore in a good position to help this match-making.

> 
If you are currently in the field or would like to find opportunities in the field or intend to work in the field later, then you want to check this out:

> 
<http://bit.ly/ntx-recruitment-slack|bit.ly/ntx-recruitment-slack>

If you dont care about neurotechnology and are not looking for contributing to the field, then indeed you can skip it.

(and also second guess what you are doing here :p)

_NeuroTechVan Fireside_ brings in world class speakers to present ideas in world of brain computer interfaces.  

> 


> 
On June the 25th, globally acclaimed theoretical physicist Dr. Cisco Gooding will help our members bridge the gap between neuroscience and cutting edge quantum research. Gooding provides an authoritative perspective of orchestrated objective reduction(OR-ORCH) and warm quantum coherence in biological systems. In addition to his various academic publications in theoretical physics Gooding is notably a research colleague of Roger Penrose, father of "OR-ORCH" theory.

> 
We invite you to attend the live stream of the event where you can ask us questions real time via twitter. Details and link to be posted shortly. 

> 


> 
This will be a connection of the two revolutionary fields in our modern day: Quantum Physics and Neuroscience. 

> 


> 
If you are in Vancouver, come hang out with us in person! We will go for beer and chicken waffles to causally catalyze networking after the event.

 **dano** :

 >a.tech: Hey you know Cisco! He's a pretty good guy

6/9/2017 4:25 PM

 **stephen** :

 >a.tech Since this can be a controversial topic, it would be helpful for you to describe more specifics about what the speaker will present, what the speaker _wont_ present (i.e. a reiteration of Penroses theories?), and the types of questions / conversations that would be constructive for attendees to bring up.

6/9/2017 4:26 PM

 **jnaulty** :

 >Quantum Physics + Neuroscience :smile:

6/9/2017 4:40 PM

 **stephen** :

 >Also, for a globally acclaimed physicist, its odd that he only has 18 citations. <https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Cisco_Gooding>

> 


> 
Its definitely possible to have a constructive conversation about quantum physics + neuroscience. You might have a few speakers representing different perspectives or interpretations. Perhaps one could play the skeptic, one could be the voice of Penrose, and one could say I land in the middle in these ways or it depends on doing these experiments that we dont yet have the tools to do. 

> 


> 
As it stands, this event doesnt seem to appreciate those nuances. I advise a policy where we call things for what they are. 

> 


> 
*To be totally clear: this smells like bullshit and seems highly inconsistent with the otherwise scientifically-credible brand of NeurotechX.*

Do others have thoughts on this?

6/9/2017 4:44 PM

 **mhough** :

 >yes, I agree I just didn't know we were having this conversation.

6/9/2017 4:48 PM

 **mhough** :

 >I can bring people, again I thought it a little out of topic but if you want to put a team together for the Penrose Prize there are people interested. I will not tolerate BS and I want it much clearer what constitutes evidence

6/9/2017 5:03 PM

 **stephen** :

 >a.tech mhough At the least, you could say at the top of the event page We acknowledge this is a controversial topic among neuroscientists and Dr. Gooding will make invest sufficient time in (1) outlining the specific claims he wants to make and (2) acknowledging and addressing the common objections to discussions and quantum physics and neuroscience.

 **mhough** :

 >We know a lot more about microtubules now

6/9/2017 5:06 PM

 **stephen** :

 >mhough Regardless of what we know about microtubules, it needs to be the case that people looking at the event page (even if they dont attend the event) see that the framing of the event was sound, and that there wasnt an unquestioned endorsement of the speaker.

6/9/2017 5:07 PM

 **stephen** :

 >This is just what you do if you want to navigate controversial territory. You put ten times the usual effort into framing the conversation in a way that retains credibility for the hosting organization.

6/9/2017 6:24 PM

 **stephen** :

 >a.tech Thats fair - my words were pretty direct. 

> 
Does the concern about framing make sense to you? How would you describe it in your own words?

6/9/2017 6:32 PM

 **a.tech** :

 >The talk is purely about the the ability of biological structures to support quantum superpositions. This is where it all starts from a quantum perspective. So any hypothesis or "theories of mind" are completely left out, since we dont have proof about this. Cisco may not have as many citations as other Rock stars, but I believe in his academic integrity to present what he knows without making it flowery.

> 


> 
We worked hard to make this talk happen because even though the idea of a quantum human mind sounds crazy, experiments in the past few years has been steadly confirming Penrose's hypothesis that microtubules can support warm quantum coherence and potentially play a role in human consciousness. 

6/9/2017 6:33 PM

 **a.tech** :

 >I do appreciate the concerns you raised though. It totally makes sense.

6/9/2017 6:34 PM

 >I will take a look at the media material we put out, and see how we can clarify the heart of the matter for our potential audience. 

6/9/2017 7:03 PM

 **mhough** :

 >Cool. Look simulations of this kind of thing are totally doable and soon building things into neuromorphic hardware will be doable too. Warm SQUIDS are doable. I want to know where the quantum computing field is and I think others should too. People use NMRs for experiments and thats something not quite OpenBCI but within the realm of the amateur let's say. Once you enter this world you only have the maths to ground you though and keeping it an engineering level is I think important

can you point me in the right direction to brush up on these experiments you refer too? or maybe there's some must-know articles to read before this talk? i know i could dive deep into google / wiki but interested to hear if you recommend specific articles / sites. very interested, and would love to learn more. cheers.

6/9/2017 7:55 PM

 **mhough** :

 >hey andrewjsauer sure. Maybe we could start a channel for this and I can get Henrik to finally join (your not here right:) and we can get concrete on both sides of this. I don't mean on the sides of the quantum debate but engineering level for both quantum and molecular biology

There are alot of uncertainties (no pun intended lol) and rather then stack on layers on unnecessary abstraction... the best approach atm is to focus on the molecular biology. Once we get a good grip on that then it'll be easier to see how the rest of it falls into play.

I have a favour to ask  my friend Tyler is a PhD candidate at the University of Toronto who is working on batteries for wearables, sensors, and other hardware devices. He is in the process of building a company, and would like 15-20 minutes of your time to determine the exact needs of the end user and any potential real-world problems that are  and may be  experienced.

This interaction could be a phone interview or a coffee in-person; whatever works best for you. If you are interested and would like to learn more, feel free to email Tyler at <mailto:tyler.brian.schon@gmail.com|tyler.brian.schon@gmail.com> to schedule a time to meet.

 >Hi everyone. As you are likely aware, the IEEE Systems, Man and Cybernetics Society is hosting the Brain Hackathon in October in Banff, AB. Projects can be submitted or participants can join existing projects (see <http://www.br41n.io/Banff-2017>). There are US$5000 in prizes and much more in hardware to be won! At this point, we need help advertising the Hackathon to students, researchers, and BCI enthusiasts in nearby towns, especially Calgary, Edmonton and even perhaps our NeuroTechVANers! If possible, can you please spread the work to your contacts, and if you live in nearby cities, please print out flyers (<https://documents.epfl.ch/users/c/ch/chavarri/www/smc2017/files/IEEE_SMC2017_BMI_Brain_Hackathon.pdf>) and help spread them around campus. And, of course, please consider signing up yourselves! Last years hackathon attracted over 200 people and we are hoping to come close to that (if not surpass) this year! Participation can be remote, as we will have a 100Mb/s internet link for the event set up. Many thanks in advance for your collaboration!

 >Hi everyone, check out this video that our <#C0VTMQ5CH|_vancouver> chapter has produced. 

> 


> 
The first half presents an intro to the limitations of mathematical logic via godel's incompleteness theorem. It also presents a crash course into key concepts in modern quantum physics. 

> 


> 
The second half of the talk digs into how these quantum physical laws may play a role in the human mind. The focus is on how current experimental research in  biology suggests that quantum information processing may be occurring in the human mind in sub-neuronal structures called micro-tubules.

Please join our <#C5RB2U1MW|quantum_systems> channel if you are interested in how non-classical phenomenon _might_ affect our current theory of mind.
