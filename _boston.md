 >Hi all! I'm going to be moving to Boston in a few months and am trying to break into the neuroeng/neurotech job market. Do any of you have a handle on that space in Boston? I'm specifically looking for resources or contacts for companies working on BCIs and/or neural implants. If it helps, my background is in biomedical/electrical engineering, neuroscience, and machine learning. I'm happy to reward helpful advice with a pint :slightly_smiling_face:

 >Hey Boston chapter! chrisnorman and I are part of an Australian neurotech startup building brain-computer interfaces. We believe neurotechnology is the most profound way to expand human potential and are working with prototype hardware and software to monitor and boost brain activity.

We're in the US this month and are currently in transit to Boston! We'll be in the area from 11-14 June and would love to meet as many of you as possible. We'd love to buy any of you coffee and talk about the things you're working on :slightly_smiling_face:
