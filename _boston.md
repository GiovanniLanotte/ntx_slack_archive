 >Hi all! I'm going to be moving to Boston in a few months and am trying to break into the neuroeng/neurotech job market. Do any of you have a handle on that space in Boston? I'm specifically looking for resources or contacts for companies working on BCIs and/or neural implants. If it helps, my background is in biomedical/electrical engineering, neuroscience, and machine learning. I'm happy to reward helpful advice with a pint :slightly_smiling_face:

We're in the US this month and are currently in transit to Boston! We'll be in the area from 11-14 June and would love to meet as many of you as possible. We'd love to buy any of you coffee and talk about the things you're working on :slightly_smiling_face:
