Neurofeedback (NFB) or EEG biofeedback is a mental training method which makes the trainee consciously aware of macroscopic activity in the brain. There is an industry of NFB training and clinicians that treats disorders, helps people improve performance, and allows exploration of consciousness. This presentation will explain how NFB works, its benefits, drivers and challenges to its widespread adoption. Also a quick overview of the evidence of its efficacy will be discussed for treating disorders and enhancing sports performance.
