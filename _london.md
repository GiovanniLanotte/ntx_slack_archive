 >Hi everyone. I'm Dawn Kolpin, a Development and Strategy Consultant for startups. I just joined the NeuroTechEDU committee. I'm currently based in the US after moving my family from London. I've been consulting in the areas of online audience, virtual communities, content strategy &amp; media development, gaming, and marketing communications since Netscape Communicator was released (so I've had the pleasure to help launch a few new technologies and platforms). I'm fascinated by educational technology, immersive technology, and our human experience with emerging technology platforms. My academic background is in Cultural Anthropology, and my professional background is in media and marketing comms, audience development, and strategic development. I love the dynamic potential of neuroscience and neurotechnology with all the hope and wonder that a non-programming futurist like myself can dream of.  I am thrilled to be working with Sydney, Yannick, and the rest of you at NeuroTechX. Thank you! [ Bio: <http://linkedin.com/in/dawnkolpin> ]

 >Hi everyone,

> 
Im Bechir from London, UK (originally from France). In the past I worked on a couple of research projects in neuroscience (visual prosthetics to restore sight to the blind in Boston, USA / machine learning applied to fMRI in Japan / decoding of pain and touch from EEG/microneurography in London) before leaving academia and working as a freelance data scientist.  I am currently part of a startup accelerator in London and I am interested in exploring consumer/industrial applications of BCI/neurotech.
