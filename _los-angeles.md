 >Hi Everyone- Id like to welcome andrewjsauer as the new co-organizer of the LA chapter of NeuroTechX. Were rebooting and renaming it to NeuroTechLA (the old name ended in LAX which was confusing because thats the name of the airport!). Stay tuned next monthAndrew and I are excited to bring this chapter back into action!

as adam and i mentioned, we are rebooting this awesome community and part of that process is hearing from you. hence, survey time! shouldn't take more than a couple minutes asking basic questions like what day of the week you prefer, etc. thank you!
