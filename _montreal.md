4/24/2017 12:36 PM

 **yannick** :

 >By _private_, we mean that we want to control the ratio of newcomers vs experienced / regulars. As seen in other chapters and in Montreal, a high ratio of newcomers during HackNights dilutes the value for everyone. We have less time for the newcomers when many of them show up and the regulars cant work properly in this demoing/explaining/talking environment. So in order to remain inclusive, but also make the most out of our HackNights for people who actually want to progress on projects, well keep people aware that HackNights are happening and that they can contact us if they are interested, but wont announce it on Meetup anymore.

 >fred-simard the hacked neurosky seems working. I see pink noise like spectrum. I haven't got ASSR or SSVEP working. Maybe due to the python library's fft (it does binning to output spectrum with 1 hz step) so I will check with raw fft data

5/27/2017 3:13 AM

 **fred-simard** :

 >naoto One thing you might want to start doing is to record your data and work on your analysis offline. I know you ultimately want an online system, but that will definitely speed up the development of your analysis since you won't depend on a live connection and you'll be free to compare multiple approach on the same data. Only after it works offline, you adapt it for an online application.

5/27/2017 3:16 AM

 **naoto** :

 >fred-simard: totally makes sense. this is something I always had a problem - since I stopped using mules, I don't have easy way to record/playback eeg signals

5/27/2017 3:17 AM

 **fred-simard** :

6/7/2017 11:52 AM

 **fred-simard** :

6/7/2017 12:46 PM

6/7/2017 1:39 PM

 **fred-simard** :

 >naoto you will be limited in choice, the frequency needs to be an integer ratio of your frame rate, but i'm sure you can find a few ratios to sweep through.

6/7/2017 2:26 PM

 **naoto** :

 >fred-simard: of course, you're right. Maybe I will experiment with Arduino + LED so I have more flexible control

6/8/2017 12:37 AM

6/9/2017 4:15 PM

 **fred-simard** :

 >naoto I recorded using 4 stimuli at frequencies: 11, 7, 5, 3 Hz. I'm working on the analysiss, but if you need more I would use 13 and 14. This is a 'one hot' coding scheme, but using combinations of frequencies would increase the number of codes exponentially.

 **fred-simard** :

 ><!channel> I'm looking for a helper to work on my EEG stuff. I'm bound to silence, but it's a very cool project and I've been working on it for about 6 months now so it's not a little thing. There is a remuneration attached to the offer, however this shouldn't be the main factor to apply, since the remuneration will be below any kind of job.

> 


> 
What I'm looking for:

> 
- someone with a lot of autonomy and with prior EEG data analysis experience. Ideally a master/PhD student who wants to build a portfolio around the development of practical EEG applications.

> 
- someone experienced with python, at least enough to develop on his own.

> 
- someone willing to enter a NDA and who will remain discreet on the exact nature of his work, until it goes public.

> 
- someone who lives in Montreal

> 


> 
Be careful, I have no problem to see someone who is in the process of learning applying, however this is not a EEG 101. I'm looking for someone who will collaborate and contribute to the project.

> 


> 
To apply:

> 
Simply send me a private message, with a summary of your qualifications, how much hours/week you think you can contribute.

 **fred-simard** :

 >I had an idea along this line a while back, even discussed it with the guys of LANDR. The first step I envisioned was to build a soiund browser, pretty much in the same way as the Neurable works. Sounds would be clustered and the subject would do some kind of gradient descent toward its desired sound.
