4/24/2017 12:36 PM

 **yannick** :

 >By _private_, we mean that we want to control the ratio of newcomers vs experienced / regulars. As seen in other chapters and in Montreal, a high ratio of newcomers during HackNights dilutes the value for everyone. We have less time for the newcomers when many of them show up and the regulars cant work properly in this demoing/explaining/talking environment. So in order to remain inclusive, but also make the most out of our HackNights for people who actually want to progress on projects, well keep people aware that HackNights are happening and that they can contact us if they are interested, but wont announce it on Meetup anymore.

 >fred-simard the hacked neurosky seems working. I see pink noise like spectrum. I haven't got ASSR or SSVEP working. Maybe due to the python library's fft (it does binning to output spectrum with 1 hz step) so I will check with raw fft data

5/27/2017 3:13 AM

 **fred-simard** :

 >naoto One thing you might want to start doing is to record your data and work on your analysis offline. I know you ultimately want an online system, but that will definitely speed up the development of your analysis since you won't depend on a live connection and you'll be free to compare multiple approach on the same data. Only after it works offline, you adapt it for an online application.

5/27/2017 3:16 AM

 **naoto** :

 >fred-simard: totally makes sense. this is something I always had a problem - since I stopped using mules, I don't have easy way to record/playback eeg signals

5/27/2017 3:17 AM

 **fred-simard** :

6/7/2017 11:52 AM

 **fred-simard** :

6/7/2017 12:46 PM

6/7/2017 1:39 PM

 **fred-simard** :

 >naoto you will be limited in choice, the frequency needs to be an integer ratio of your frame rate, but i'm sure you can find a few ratios to sweep through.

6/7/2017 2:26 PM

 **naoto** :

 >fred-simard: of course, you're right. Maybe I will experiment with Arduino + LED so I have more flexible control

6/8/2017 12:37 AM

6/9/2017 4:15 PM

 **fred-simard** :

 >naoto I recorded using 4 stimuli at frequencies: 11, 7, 5, 3 Hz. I'm working on the analysiss, but if you need more I would use 13 and 14. This is a 'one hot' coding scheme, but using combinations of frequencies would increase the number of codes exponentially.
