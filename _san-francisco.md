I'm trying to spend my next 6 month internship (from July - December) working in SF at a neurotech company either in the role of hardware engineering, bioinformatics, or product management

 >Hi ! Im co-organising a workshop on brain computing for neuroscientists in Inria (France), Stanford and Berkeley.  We would like to invite someone to present the neurotechX community.  Whats the organisation like in San Francisco?  Is this something you do?

3/31/2017 6:14 PM

 **pierre** :

 >Heya joke.d, I'm leading the Berkeley chapter and involved in the SF chapter. Both groups have people that have talked about the NeurotechX community (especially NeurotechSF). What would this workshop be like? Where and when is it happening?

3/31/2017 6:17 PM

 **joke.d** :

 >Its on June 9 in Berkeley.

3/31/2017 6:18 PM

 **pierre** :

 >What's it like? What would you expect from us?

3/31/2017 6:19 PM

 **pierre** :

 >We could have people at Neurotech Berkeley demo devices, or just talk about our Neurotech groups

3/31/2017 6:19 PM

 **joke.d** :

 >Can I maybe write you an email?

3/31/2017 6:19 PM

 **joke.d** :

 >The people attending are working on informatics and statistics (for example machine learning for resting state fMRI), and wed like to give an overview of what is happening in the field, inside and outside of academia.

 **pierre** :

 >Ah I see

3/31/2017 6:22 PM
