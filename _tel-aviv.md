 **jfrey** :

 ><!channel> Hello there! I will be moving to Tel Aviv by the end of the month, joining the IDC and the milab (<http://milab.idc.ac.il/>) as a post-doc. I will try to push there some of my work about a shared bio/neurofeedback in the ambient space.  I have been working with BCI during my thesis, I'm quite eager to hack stuff and I've been "touched" by NTX since my visit in montreal a year and a half ago (already!). At last I will arrive in a place where there is an official NTX chapter (I've been in France up until now, Bordeaux and lately Lyon), hence I'm eager to see what you guys are doing in here :slightly_smiling_face:
