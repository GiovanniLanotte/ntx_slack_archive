- Neurodoro (Developing a CNN-based machine learning algorithm to detect focus and mental fatigue; Keras, Tensorflow)

> 
- EEG 101 (Interactive EEG tutorial; Java, signal processing, data collection for offline mode!)

> 
- Gamma light (Detecting increases in neural gamma frequency during optical gamma stimulation; Xamarin mobile app, Java)

> 
- EEG and VR? Get an example Unity app running with Muse integration

> 


> 
If you're a first time hack attendee, PM me to be added to the guest list.  All you regulars, we'll see you there!

4/19/2017 3:28 AM

 **graeme** :

 >Yeah, we're just looking for someone who can come in and provide some basic unity support on experimentation with Muse+Vive. Low level signal integration and neuroscience validation stuff moreso than cool BCI experiences. Neurotech enthusiasts with that kind of experience and interest welcome to apply.

- EEG 101 has a Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier! This week we'll implement in React Native and test it

- Neurodoro has a functional cognitive test! Now we can collect data and run TPOT to look for regression algorithms that can correlate EEG data with cognitive performance
