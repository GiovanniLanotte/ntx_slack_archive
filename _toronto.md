> 
Our next hacknight is this Thursday at VarageSale. Come fiddle with neurotech software and meet other neurotechers. 

> 


> 
Current Projects:

> 
- Neurodoro (Developing a CNN-based machine learning algorithm to detect focus and mental fatigue; Keras, Tensorflow)

> 
- EEG 101 (Interactive EEG tutorial; Java, signal processing, data collection for offline mode!)

> 
- Gamma light (Detecting increases in neural gamma frequency during optical gamma stimulation; Xamarin mobile app, Java)

> 
- EEG and VR? Get an example Unity app running with Muse integration

> 


> 
If you're a first time hack attendee, PM me to be added to the guest list.  All you regulars, we'll see you there!

4/18/2017 6:00 PM

 **graeme** :

 >If anyone gets a Unity VR app running and integrated with Muse, I'd love to see it, and I might have a part time job for you.

4/18/2017 6:12 PM

 **yannick** :

 >We did and Im sure youd love to see the integrated Muse-IO console in Unity, plotting the EEG signal.

4/19/2017 3:08 AM

 **sydneyneurotechx** :

 >graeme  Maybe post the VR/EEG idea in Opportunities?

4/19/2017 3:08 AM

 **sydneyneurotechx** :

 >Unless you want people specifically from TO

4/19/2017 3:28 AM

 **graeme** :

 >Yeah, we're just looking for someone who can come in and provide some basic unity support on experimentation with Muse+Vive. Low level signal integration and neuroscience validation stuff moreso than cool BCI experiences. Neurotech enthusiasts with that kind of experience and interest welcome to apply.

4/20/2017 4:14 PM

 **dano** :
