 >I agree with omer, I feel like they've simply repackaged their original device to make it sexier and to fit on a VR strap. Ending up raising $100k during a "Marketing Campaign" (because I doubt they needed the money to do the device in the first place).

Fisher Wallace Stimulator has one of the few Brain Stim Devices that received FDA Clearance - so I'm more confident than if it was random people.

That way they just open a new market segment, but keep (arguably) their scientific validation they did in previous studies, since it was on somewhat related topics (sleep &amp; stress).
