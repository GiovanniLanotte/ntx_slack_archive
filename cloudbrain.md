 >Hey dano. Sorry I just saw that. Yes yoy can send data to cloudbrain with the muse. Do you mind emailing me directly at <mailto:leborgne.mar@gmail.com|leborgne.mar@gmail.com> to continue the conversation? I don't always get slack notifications

 >Just met a guy in Toronto starting a company called Lucid <http://transmediazone.ca/teams/lucid/>

 **dano** :

 >He's built a color-therapy/music-therapy chamber that uses EEG to entrain the brain to a relaxed state and said his next project might be a multi-user collaborative experience

 **dano** :

 >I pointed him to CloudBrain as being a potential solution for him (sounded like he was more of a sound designer/hacker than a backend dev)

 **dano** :

 >Is anyone working on this right now? I'd love to get a roadmap so that if we find any interested devs in Toronto we can point them to the project to contribute

 **aj** :

 >There are for sure people working on this they just don't use this as a place to talk about it

7/28/2017 8:58 PM

 **dano** :

 >Ok

7/28/2017 8:59 PM

 **dano** :

 >That kind of touches on another point I'm curious about: how open is CloudBrain at this point? I know some of it is being developed closed.

 >You should talk with marion &amp; w to have the latest status and direction of the project.

 **fred-simard** :

 >marion w Hey guys, you have a fantastic project. I'm convinced that a cloud-based data infrastructure is the present and future for EEG in general. I worked on the premise of a MongoDB server myself, but I have to focus on my other endeavors. Can you tell us more about the services you guys are providing and how you are providing them. I could ask privately, but I believe many will be interested by the answer.

 >I'm pretty sure they are traveling but they offer data injestion through your own account and are working on modules to do black box physiology data.

8/25/2017 4:24 PM

 **fred-simard** :

 >ah ok, so the data analytics takes place in a black box.

8/25/2017 4:25 PM

 **fred-simard** :

 >Does the user keep ownership of the data? Can a user data be used to train algorithmic tools that will then be used with other clients?

8/25/2017 4:26 PM

 **fred-simard** :

 >And if not too much asking, what is the business model?

8/28/2017 4:03 PM

 **marion** :

 >Hey Fred. Yes, we were traveling (I'm still in France). For the alpha release of cloudbrain you'll be able to create an account and securely send data to the cloud platform. At this point you can use our hosted analytics modules or make one of your own by just reinjecting the data into the module you created. Re analytics : Actually, not all analytics modules are black boxed.  You can find the open source ones on github (eye blinks / muscle artifact filtering, notch filter, FFT, basic classifier, etc.) The user keeps ownership in the data in the sense that we do not give anyone access to this data. However, it is hosted in our database. About the business model... I am working on that and don't have a definite answer yet. We're thinking subscriptions based (depending on the amount of data you want to store, and the more advanced analytics modules). I'm happy to talk more. PM me.
