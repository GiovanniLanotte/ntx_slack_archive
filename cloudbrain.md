 >Hey dano. Sorry I just saw that. Yes yoy can send data to cloudbrain with the muse. Do you mind emailing me directly at <mailto:leborgne.mar@gmail.com|leborgne.mar@gmail.com> to continue the conversation? I don't always get slack notifications

 >Just met a guy in Toronto starting a company called Lucid <http://transmediazone.ca/teams/lucid/>

 **dano** :

 >He's built a color-therapy/music-therapy chamber that uses EEG to entrain the brain to a relaxed state and said his next project might be a multi-user collaborative experience

 **dano** :

 >I pointed him to CloudBrain as being a potential solution for him (sounded like he was more of a sound designer/hacker than a backend dev)

 **dano** :

 >Is anyone working on this right now? I'd love to get a roadmap so that if we find any interested devs in Toronto we can point them to the project to contribute

 >There are for sure people working on this they just don't use this as a place to talk about it

7/28/2017 8:58 PM

 **dano** :

 >Ok

 **dano** :

 >That kind of touches on another point I'm curious about: how open is CloudBrain at this point? I know some of it is being developed closed.

 >You should talk with marion &amp; w to have the latest status and direction of the project.

 **fred-simard** :

 >marion w Hey guys, you have a fantastic project. I'm convinced that a cloud-based data infrastructure is the present and future for EEG in general. I worked on the premise of a MongoDB server myself, but I have to focus on my other endeavors. Can you tell us more about the services you guys are providing and how you are providing them. I could ask privately, but I believe many will be interested by the answer.

 >I'm pretty sure they are traveling but they offer data injestion through your own account and are working on modules to do black box physiology data.

 **fred-simard** :

 >ah ok, so the data analytics takes place in a black box.

 **fred-simard** :

 >Does the user keep ownership of the data? Can a user data be used to train algorithmic tools that will then be used with other clients?

 >And if not too much asking, what is the business model?
