 **dlz** :

 >I'm not sure how it is license-wise with the availability of the data, but we were able to relatively easily access the affective values from the suite (also, from the looks of your screenshot an older version...) with mindYourOSC's in processing, you should be able to just select these values in there (I used an emotiv with research license though, so we had access to all data on it, maybe that makes a difference)

 >Hi everyone, if you do research and are interested in social interactions and physiological sensors at large, you might have a look at a special session that will take place during ACII: "Brain and physiological signals for multi-user modeling". Here is the associated website: <http://www.affective-sciences.org/en/bps-mum> We would be glad to get your contributions, I am sure NeuroTechX folks around here do pretty amazing science :slightly_smiling_face:

 >Hey, I'm currently working on a presentation about the latest news &amp; breakthroughs in NeuroTech, focusing on 2016 (kind of a review). We'd like for the different NTX chapters to have access to it and do an event to showcase what's new in the field. From "wow" kinda news to scientific breakthroughs, to new kickstarters, to new laws, to major investments, etc.

> 
The goal of the presentation (and the event) is that when you leave, you feel like you have the big picture of what happened lately - without digging too much into the science of it, but staying at a higher level. 

> 
And obviously you'd leave inspired, because the field is awesome :stuck_out_tongue:

> 


> 
1) Do you know any review already online that could be useful?

> 
2) What would you put in that review/presentation? (what for you, is worth mentioning that happened in 2016)

> 
3) If you'd like to help with the content and/or the presentation, please PM me :slightly_smiling_face:

> 
Feel free to throw anything that comes to mind!

> 
(obviously the presentation will be accessible/shared)

 >Hey everyone, big news: Mindsets Kickstarter goes live tomorrow morning at 8am EST!

> 
For those of you who arent familiar, Mindset is a pair of overear headphones that integrate EEG sensors into the band to measure and improve concentration. Theyre bluetooth, noise cancelling, and give you full access to the data. You can get more info at <http://thinkmindset.com|thinkmindset.com>, which will also redirect to the Kickstarter once its up.

> 
The campaign goes live tomorrow at 8am EST. Be the first to grab one of the early birds, and get 46% off! :smile:

Feel free to give me a shout at 438 838 1477 if you need help, or check out this video explaining how to back kickstarter projects <http://bit.ly/2msDIdZ>.

 >jacobflood: Congrats on the Kickstarter launch!  One question though, did you research the trademark on the name "MindSet"? Neurosky's first consumer EEG (in 2009) was also called the MindSet, and was based around an audio headphone design. A quick Google turns up some articles and even the manual which feature a (TM) by the name. 

3/1/2017 9:46 PM

 **jacobflood** :

 >Thanks for the support! 

> 
Were aware, and as we understand the product is discontinued, and not currently under trademark. Could you send us the trademark manual you found?

3/1/2017 10:03 PM

 **sc** :

 >Sure, and good luck with it all, just something which stood out as soon as spotted. In any case this manual has the (TM) symbol at least once <http://developer.neurosky.com/docs/doku.php?id=mindset_instruction_manual> and this Reseller Agreementon the Necomimi site lists MindSet as a NeuroSky trademark <http://store.necomimi.com/pages/reseller-agreement>

3/1/2017 10:20 PM

 **jacobflood** :

 >Good to know! Id seen that as well, but when we did a formal trademark search we didnt find anything filed. Were concluding the filing in the next few days
