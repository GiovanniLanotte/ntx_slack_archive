 **pawel** :

 >Hi, My name is Pawel (Paul). Im a neuropsychologist and the CEO of Polish company specialized in engineering of equipment for neuroscientists, supporting the labs and equipping them. We have a lot of successful science projects around neuroscience and few commercialized products. My work and passion is neuroscience, a dream - to be a part of the team who will build neuroprosthesis. I believe I will reach this goal soon. As a member of NeuroTechX I will try to organize next chapter in Europe - here, in Poland :wink:.

 **dk360** :

 >Hi everyone. I'm Dawn Kolpin, a Development and Strategy Consultant for startups. I'm currently based in Colorado (US) after moving my family here from London (#_London), and before that Silicon Valley. I've been consulting in the areas of online audience, virtual communities, content strategy &amp; media development, gaming, and marketing communications since Netscape Communicator was released (so I've had the pleasure to help launch a few new technologies and platforms). I'm fascinated by educational technology, immersive technology, and human experience with emerging technology platforms. My academic background is in Cultural Anthropology. I love the dynamic potential of neurotechnology, cognitive feedback, AI (and even implants) with all the hope that a non-programming futurist like me can dream of.  I am thrilled to be working with Sydney, Yannick, and the rest of you at NeuroTechX. Thank you! [ Bio: <http://linkedin.com/in/dawnkolpin> ]

 **gidea** :

 >Hi everyone! I'm Vlad Gidea from Copenhagen. I've been working and building tech products so far, and in the past years grew an interest in neuroscience and brain computer interfaces. I'm currently playing around with Emotiv and with an OpenBCI kit (ganglion board and various headset prototypes) and I'm still learning a lot in this area. My goal is to build an API that enables app developers to build smartphone applications or cloud solutions (I call it <http://brain2.io|brain2.io>). I feel more people should be able to track their mental activity and come up with novel ways that in can improve our daily lives. Let me know if you're from Copenhagen or if you have any connections here. I'm considering starting a Neurotechx chapter if there is enough interest in the local community.

 >Hi there, I am Jörn from Germany. Got invited here after I helped someone about NIRS devices. Got a Bachelor in Knowledge Engineer, Master and PhD in Cognitive Neuroscience (working on BCI with EEG and MEG among other things), and now working at one of the few NIRS/fNIRS companies in the world (<http://www.artinis.com|www.artinis.com>). I am always happy to help if you have any questions about these topics.

 **watson** :

 >Greetings from San Francisco! Im Watson, pulled into the NTX world through marion after we teamed up on the Cognitive Technology Exploratorium exhibit ( <http://www.explorecogtech.com/> ) back in 2015. My background is in Computational Neuroscience (BS from MIT and Applied Math PhD from UC Davis). My focus has shifted over the years from building neuro-inspired AI towards building technology that augments our own intelligence through triggering awareness and guiding intervention in the moment at those moments that matter most (onset of anxiety etc). While I have interest in EEG my primary interests these days is on RR interval heart signal analyses (via ECG or PPG), electrodermal activity (i.e. galvanic skin response), EMG and other such simple signals which give us a window into our autonomic nervous system and hence emotional orientation etc. Are there other folks on this slack team who share such interests?

3/22/2017 9:23 PM

 **sydneyneurotechx** :

 >Welcome watson !

3/22/2017 9:25 PM

 **sydneyneurotechx** :

 >I have an interest, although I don't have the background yet to fully get it. I purchased the empatica embrace as I was looking for a cheap EDA unit, however didn't realize that they haven't launched the API yet :disappointed:. However a future project does involve multi modal input (Current have a EEG, EDA and EKG device)

3/23/2017 8:44 AM

 **davidevaleriani** :

 >Hey watson, welcome to NTX. I've interest too in RR peaks and GSR, especially for their correlates with decision making. What are you using them for? Emotions?

3/23/2017 11:40 AM

 **vasilisa** :

 >Hi, everyone! I am Vasilisa from Singapore (originally from Belarus). I am doing PhD in BCI :slightly_smiling_face: My topic is feature extraction from EEG for Motor Imagery BCI. Happy to join community!

 **okbalefthanded** :

 >vasilisa are you pursuing the PhD with Pr. Cuntai Guan group?

3/23/2017 11:14 PM

 **watson** :

 >davidevaleriani , sydneyneurotechx : great! Ive created the channel <#C4NA4CTK3|autonomic-system> to focus on topics related to autonomic (and peripheral more generally) NS & Im interested in emotional orientation (anxious, excited, &) and general cognitive state (e.g. sleepy, focused etc).

3/24/2017 4:03 AM

 **vasilisa** :

 >okbalefthanded no :slightly_smiling_face: but I know few people from their group.

 **maxim** :

 >Hi everyone! I'm Max. I got Muse several months ago and recently got an idea to try actually get some fun data out of it

3/26/2017 10:21 PM

 **maxim** :

 >First idea is to try to do a meditation timer app, that would also record Muse data, saving them for future analysis. Having an additional signal to "focus back on the breath" + recording ambient noise through phone mic (to detect outside distraction) seems like might be enough for some data analysis. Does it sound plausible?

3/27/2017 12:28 AM

 **vitruvia** :

 >Helo guys. I'm a medical student with interest in programming and I've just found out about NeuroTechX. Happy to meet you!

 **vitruvia** :

 >I'm very new to biohacking, programming, and neuroscience, by the way. Hopefully I'll be able to grow and help out.
