 **dk360** :

 >Hi everyone. I'm Dawn Kolpin, a Development and Strategy Consultant for startups. I'm currently based in Colorado (US) after moving my family here from London (#_London), and before that Silicon Valley. I've been consulting in the areas of online audience, virtual communities, content strategy &amp; media development, gaming, and marketing communications since Netscape Communicator was released (so I've had the pleasure to help launch a few new technologies and platforms). I'm fascinated by educational technology, immersive technology, and human experience with emerging technology platforms. My academic background is in Cultural Anthropology. I love the dynamic potential of neurotechnology, cognitive feedback, AI (and even implants) with all the hope that a non-programming futurist like me can dream of.  I am thrilled to be working with Sydney, Yannick, and the rest of you at NeuroTechX. Thank you! [ Bio: <http://linkedin.com/in/dawnkolpin> ]

 **gidea** :

 >Hi everyone! I'm Vlad Gidea from Copenhagen. I've been working and building tech products so far, and in the past years grew an interest in neuroscience and brain computer interfaces. I'm currently playing around with Emotiv and with an OpenBCI kit (ganglion board and various headset prototypes) and I'm still learning a lot in this area. My goal is to build an API that enables app developers to build smartphone applications or cloud solutions (I call it <http://brain2.io|brain2.io>). I feel more people should be able to track their mental activity and come up with novel ways that in can improve our daily lives. Let me know if you're from Copenhagen or if you have any connections here. I'm considering starting a Neurotechx chapter if there is enough interest in the local community.

 **watson** :

 >Greetings from San Francisco! Im Watson, pulled into the NTX world through marion after we teamed up on the Cognitive Technology Exploratorium exhibit ( <http://www.explorecogtech.com/> ) back in 2015. My background is in Computational Neuroscience (BS from MIT and Applied Math PhD from UC Davis). My focus has shifted over the years from building neuro-inspired AI towards building technology that augments our own intelligence through triggering awareness and guiding intervention in the moment at those moments that matter most (onset of anxiety etc). While I have interest in EEG my primary interests these days is on RR interval heart signal analyses (via ECG or PPG), electrodermal activity (i.e. galvanic skin response), EMG and other such simple signals which give us a window into our autonomic nervous system and hence emotional orientation etc. Are there other folks on this slack team who share such interests?

3/22/2017 9:23 PM

 **sydneyneurotechx** :

 >Welcome watson !

3/22/2017 9:25 PM

 **sydneyneurotechx** :

 >I have an interest, although I don't have the background yet to fully get it. I purchased the empatica embrace as I was looking for a cheap EDA unit, however didn't realize that they haven't launched the API yet :disappointed:. However a future project does involve multi modal input (Current have a EEG, EDA and EKG device)

3/23/2017 8:44 AM

 **davidevaleriani** :

 >Hey watson, welcome to NTX. I've interest too in RR peaks and GSR, especially for their correlates with decision making. What are you using them for? Emotions?

 **watson** :

 >davidevaleriani , sydneyneurotechx : great! Ive created the channel <#C4NA4CTK3|autonomic-system> to focus on topics related to autonomic (and peripheral more generally) NS & Im interested in emotional orientation (anxious, excited, &) and general cognitive state (e.g. sleepy, focused etc).

 **maxim** :

 >Hi everyone! I'm Max. I got Muse several months ago and recently got an idea to try actually get some fun data out of it

3/26/2017 10:21 PM

 **maxim** :

 >First idea is to try to do a meditation timer app, that would also record Muse data, saving them for future analysis. Having an additional signal to "focus back on the breath" + recording ambient noise through phone mic (to detect outside distraction) seems like might be enough for some data analysis. Does it sound plausible?

 >What an epic community. I co-direct Deep Science Ventures (<http://www.dsv.io|www.dsv.io>). We take scientists and engineers pre-idea, provide a basic income + facilities to generate exceptionally ambitious companies from scratch. Our batches contain as many disciplines as we can find - from biomedical engineers and synthetic biologists through to chaos theorists and hardcore statisticians*. And obviously neuroscientists. We've got a start date for London in July, DM if you'd like to be paid to invent things (and keep your IP). 

> 


> 
My co-director is a neuro-pharmacologist and AI PhD, he was first author on the paper that this article is about, controlling robots with cultures of rat brain neurons: <https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg19926696-100-rise-of-the-rat-brained-robots/> 

> 


> 
Understandably, we're exceptionally excited and well-placed to build commercial technologies to do with the brain. Get in touch if you're looking for other people who want to focus on something like this!

Thanks to bechir for pointing this out!

*Yes. We believe statisticians can be hardcore.

5/18/2017 12:46 AM

 **tfunck** :

 >yannick Hi Yannick, not quite as his work is related to source reconstruction for EEG/MEG  + fMRI. I took his course a few years ago though, great stuff. I still see him around the MNI from time to time, but I think he did indeed move to Concordia.

 >Hey Im Xavier. I have unique first-hand experience with the brain. I cofounded a tech startup in Silicon Valley few years ago. We raised more than a million dollars, and eventually our startup got interrupted by my acute severe traumatic brain injury following a car accident. I had to experiment on to that to fix myself, and Im looking for my next professional move at the crossing between the brain, health and tech. Btw Im fullstack engineer and I am in Belgium for now :slightly_smiling_face:

 >Hi all I'm Nick!  I just finished my first year of university studying neuroscience, I had a great time in my program and genuinely love the field of neuroscience already.  I have always had a deep interest in engineering, computer programming, and the intersection between biology, technology, and society. Luckily these interests led me to find NeuroTechX! I'm interested in starting some kind of chapter or club at my university that will allow for neuroscience and engineering/computer science to meet and flourish and I believe that this is a great way to start that process.

5/18/2017 4:51 PM
