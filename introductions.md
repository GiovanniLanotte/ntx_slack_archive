 **dk360** :

 >Hi everyone. I'm Dawn Kolpin, a Development and Strategy Consultant for startups. I'm currently based in Colorado (US) after moving my family here from London (#_London), and before that Silicon Valley. I've been consulting in the areas of online audience, virtual communities, content strategy &amp; media development, gaming, and marketing communications since Netscape Communicator was released (so I've had the pleasure to help launch a few new technologies and platforms). I'm fascinated by educational technology, immersive technology, and human experience with emerging technology platforms. My academic background is in Cultural Anthropology. I love the dynamic potential of neurotechnology, cognitive feedback, AI (and even implants) with all the hope that a non-programming futurist like me can dream of.  I am thrilled to be working with Sydney, Yannick, and the rest of you at NeuroTechX. Thank you! [ Bio: <http://linkedin.com/in/dawnkolpin> ]

 **gidea** :

 >Hi everyone! I'm Vlad Gidea from Copenhagen. I've been working and building tech products so far, and in the past years grew an interest in neuroscience and brain computer interfaces. I'm currently playing around with Emotiv and with an OpenBCI kit (ganglion board and various headset prototypes) and I'm still learning a lot in this area. My goal is to build an API that enables app developers to build smartphone applications or cloud solutions (I call it <http://brain2.io|brain2.io>). I feel more people should be able to track their mental activity and come up with novel ways that in can improve our daily lives. Let me know if you're from Copenhagen or if you have any connections here. I'm considering starting a Neurotechx chapter if there is enough interest in the local community.

 **watson** :

 >Greetings from San Francisco! Im Watson, pulled into the NTX world through marion after we teamed up on the Cognitive Technology Exploratorium exhibit ( <http://www.explorecogtech.com/> ) back in 2015. My background is in Computational Neuroscience (BS from MIT and Applied Math PhD from UC Davis). My focus has shifted over the years from building neuro-inspired AI towards building technology that augments our own intelligence through triggering awareness and guiding intervention in the moment at those moments that matter most (onset of anxiety etc). While I have interest in EEG my primary interests these days is on RR interval heart signal analyses (via ECG or PPG), electrodermal activity (i.e. galvanic skin response), EMG and other such simple signals which give us a window into our autonomic nervous system and hence emotional orientation etc. Are there other folks on this slack team who share such interests?

3/22/2017 9:23 PM

 **sydneyneurotechx** :

 >Welcome watson !

3/22/2017 9:25 PM

 **sydneyneurotechx** :

 >I have an interest, although I don't have the background yet to fully get it. I purchased the empatica embrace as I was looking for a cheap EDA unit, however didn't realize that they haven't launched the API yet :disappointed:. However a future project does involve multi modal input (Current have a EEG, EDA and EKG device)

3/23/2017 8:44 AM

 **davidevaleriani** :

 >Hey watson, welcome to NTX. I've interest too in RR peaks and GSR, especially for their correlates with decision making. What are you using them for? Emotions?

 **watson** :

 >davidevaleriani , sydneyneurotechx : great! Ive created the channel <#C4NA4CTK3|autonomic-system> to focus on topics related to autonomic (and peripheral more generally) NS & Im interested in emotional orientation (anxious, excited, &) and general cognitive state (e.g. sleepy, focused etc).

 **maxim** :

 >Hi everyone! I'm Max. I got Muse several months ago and recently got an idea to try actually get some fun data out of it

3/26/2017 10:21 PM

 **maxim** :

 >First idea is to try to do a meditation timer app, that would also record Muse data, saving them for future analysis. Having an additional signal to "focus back on the breath" + recording ambient noise through phone mic (to detect outside distraction) seems like might be enough for some data analysis. Does it sound plausible?

 >What an epic community. I co-direct Deep Science Ventures (<http://www.dsv.io|www.dsv.io>). We take scientists and engineers pre-idea, provide a basic income + facilities to generate exceptionally ambitious companies from scratch. Our batches contain as many disciplines as we can find - from biomedical engineers and synthetic biologists through to chaos theorists and hardcore statisticians*. And obviously neuroscientists. We've got a start date for London in July, DM if you'd like to be paid to invent things (and keep your IP). 

> 


> 
My co-director is a neuro-pharmacologist and AI PhD, he was first author on the paper that this article is about, controlling robots with cultures of rat brain neurons: <https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg19926696-100-rise-of-the-rat-brained-robots/> 

> 


> 
Understandably, we're exceptionally excited and well-placed to build commercial technologies to do with the brain. Get in touch if you're looking for other people who want to focus on something like this!

> 
Thanks to bechir for pointing this out!

> 
*Yes. We believe statisticians can be hardcore.

 >H! Everyone,

> 
My name is Sharif and I'm currently doing my Masters studies in Cognitive Psychology. I find computational and mathematical modelings of human behavior very exciting, and my thesis is about prediction of experienced emotions with Game Theory models. I'm looking forward to get to know the community and hopefully exchange some ideas if anyone here is interested in these fields.

One of the main projects that I am involved with is S.E.E.D. ( <https://vimeo.com/184643912> ) which will be showcased at Nuit Blanche Toronto, Mutek Montreal and Franz Mayer Museum in Mexico City - I am wondering if there are any students/researchers/professionals that might be interested in collaborating on this project !

 >Hi everyone! My name is Saskia, but most people call me Ski. I am a behavior analyst in Phoenix, AZ working with children on the autism spectrum. I am in the process of developing my own practice and am interested in using advances in technology to support the children I work with. For example, I've purchased a EDA wrist band to assist in better understanding the function of a behavior rather than just collecting data based on what I perceive or what is told to me by the family. I have also become really interested in VR for teaching social skills, but need to do more research in this area for any adverse effects. Anyway that's a little bit about me, I'm excited to learn more about the NeuroTechX community!

6/24/2017 8:36 PM

 **rasmus** :

 >Hello everyone! My name is Rasmus and I'm an entrepreneur by heart. I have one miserably unsuccessful startup of my own under my belt, and currently I spend my days working for a big a startup. I find the future of neurotechnology highly exciting and meaningful field to work on and I'd love to start learning more about it. As a complete newbie to this subject, I intend to start the journey by going through a stack of textbooks about the field I have on my bedside table. Once I have something to contribute, I'd very much like to be able to take part in the conversation. Happy to meet you all! :v:

 >Hello All, glad I found the NeuroTechX community! Looking forward to learning more.  Through my work at UCSD a few years ago, I started a blog on cognitive health that's turned into a niche media site.

 **sydneyneurotechx** :

 >rasmus: Welcome Rasmus!  I co-founded a startup incubator and I've discovered that the majority of people fail their first startup. As long as you persist and learn quickly from your mistakes, you'll make it. I've seem companies be laughed at only to make it to big accelerators like YC.

If you don't feel comfortable contributing just yet, there are also some channels that are less Neurotech related which you can can join such as <#C073WQK34|random>, however never be afraid to share a thought or question!
