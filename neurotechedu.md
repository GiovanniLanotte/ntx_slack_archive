 **francescacoo** :

 >Hi everybody, here I am starting with the questions about building content... sorry if they are basic... 

> 
I have access to online libraries through my university, so I was reading an article on the IEEE digital library. If I want to add a picture found in the article, can I do it? Of course referencing it correctly. I know I can for my university assignments, but I am not really sure about this case. Thanks a lot!

4/6/2017 1:28 AM

 **sydneyneurotechx** :

 >hmm unsure davidevaleriani alexandre.barachant  sheida hectordomorozco  Any ideas?

4/6/2017 2:38 AM

 **sheida** :

 >francescacoo yes I don't see any issue as long as you are referencing it, once it's published it is meant for the public to see! 

4/6/2017 10:06 AM

 **davidevaleriani** :

 >mmmh not necessarily, it depends on the copyright, sometimes (like in the case of IEEE) you have to request a permission for that. Have a look here <https://www.ieee.org/publications_standards/publications/rights/reqperm.html>

4/6/2017 10:55 AM

 **francescacoo** :

 >thank you! So I guess that each journal has its own rules.. I will check that next time :wink:

4/6/2017 12:55 PM

 **sydneyneurotechx** :

 >If you need any help on getting permission francescacoo  let me know !

4/6/2017 4:21 PM

 **francescacoo** :

 >I tried through the link davidevaleriani posted and it came up a price of 225.00 USD :scream: I guess it's not that important to use that picture :stuck_out_tongue: but good to know how it works! Hopefully I can just cite the journal without using images or copying their text! I will try to learn more about copyrights while writing the content!

> 
sheida I believe the difference is because this is a published journal / paper so not available for the public?

4/6/2017 4:22 PM

 **davidevaleriani** :

 >An alternative would be to contact the author, ask for his/her permission and then slightly change the figure

4/6/2017 4:25 PM

 **davidevaleriani** :

 >It gives me $125 if I ask to reuse a picture of one of my papers :expressionless:

4/6/2017 4:33 PM

 **sydneyneurotechx** :

 >Doesn't the Author of the paper also manage it's rights davidevaleriani ? If you get the authors permission, couldn't they give access for free?

4/6/2017 4:33 PM

 **davidevaleriani** :

 >Not with IEEE, you give rights to them when you publish the paper (that's why you sign the copyright form).

4/6/2017 4:58 PM

4/12/2017 5:29 PM

 **pierre** :

 >I agree that you should use Python 3. If you're at all unsure, it's not too hard to write code that's backwards compatible with python 2 as well

4/12/2017 5:37 PM

 **davidevaleriani** :

 >Also, scripts written in Python 2 could be easily converted into Python 3 with the 2to3 program <https://docs.python.org/2/library/2to3.html>

4/12/2017 5:38 PM

 **davidevaleriani** :

 >(and there is also a 3to2 package <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/3to2>)

4/12/2017 5:38 PM

 **yrenard** :

 >Just mind the `if a syntactical conversion is possible`

4/12/2017 5:40 PM

 **yrenard** :

 >For instance the division `/` in python 2 results in integers division if both operands are integers - In python 3, this is a floating point division and you should use the '//' operator if you ever wanted to do an integer division (the rounding still is different but who cares at this point)

4/12/2017 5:40 PM

 **yrenard** :

 >This sums up to the fact that Python 2 and Python 3 are two different languages with a very similar set of features and syntax similarities

 **ch.yumin** :

 >hey guys, can someone help me? What exactly is 'epoch' or 'epoching' in BCIs? From my first researches, i think that it's the signal after the preprocessing. But i'm not sure about this

4/14/2017 5:34 PM

 **davidevaleriani** :

 >Hey ch.yumin, an epoch is generally a chunk of EEG recording (usually after preprocessing, yes). The most used type of epoch is the stimulus-locked, which means that we consider 0 the onset of the stimulus and then we extract the first N milliseconds after that. So, if N is 1500, we are sampling at 32 Hz and we have 100 stimuli, we will have 100 signals of 48 samples (1.5s * 32) for each electrode, so 100 epochs of 48 samples per electrode.

 >sydneyneurotechx So, I just finished going through the draft of intro to Neuroscience. I commented some stuff around. I think that my main concern is that these is not really Intro to Neuroscience, but it almost has the contents of at least 3 or 4 different courses on Neuroscience. I feel that some of this information is not really necessary for a person that wants to go into NeuroTech (For instance, the historical evolution of Neuroscience).

I also think you guys should check out the Medical Neuroscience Course from Duke University. It has a very nice outline and it actually has materials on almost all the things you want to cover (they dont talk at all about EEG-MEG-FMRI&).

 >Hi, during my phd, I dived into the functional optical neuroimaging. Optical intrinsic imaging (hemodynamics and scattering), laser speckle contrast imaging, laser doppler and fluorescence. I could make a short review with links to original works and diy setups. Do you need any of these?

10/1/2017 5:00 PM

 **sydneyneurotechx** :

 >ryanlintott yup! But you can set it to your timezone I believe

10/1/2017 7:13 PM

 **ryanlintott** :

 >sydneyneurotechx It looks like the event only shows one time and I assume its EST and not my local time (as I doubt you would schedule meetings for 11:00 GMT). It says on Doddle that you can set an event to use timezones but its not on by default and I dont think its on for this poll. Might be a handy feature in the future.

10/2/2017 9:58 PM

 >Thanks for letting us know Francesca!

10/10/2017 9:55 PM

 **ryanlintott** :

 >Quick question. I was wondering what setup people are using to edit and preview their work. Ive figured out how to install and run Jekyll and host a local version of the website. I have also installed Atom with several packages. The one thing I cant seem to figure out is how to get the code highlighting to work one way for markdown and another for the code blocks of python or other languages used within it. Is there a way to do this in Atom or in another editor? Is there perhaps a completely different and much better setup for this kind of work that Im missing?

10/13/2017 4:46 PM

 **ryanlintott** :

 >Another question to whomever added the GIF images to intro to neuroscience.  I am trying to fix the formatting but the giphy paths lead only to private giphy images. Were these perhaps uploaded to giphy privately for this purpose as a temporary measure? Is there anywhere that I could find this content? Thanks.

10/16/2017 9:23 PM

 **jfrayshe** :

 >I had the same problem. sydneyneurotechx any suggestions?

10/16/2017 9:24 PM

 **jfrayshe** :

 >Cheers thank you for this Ryan.

10/17/2017 7:35 AM

 **francescacoo** :

 >Hey Ryan, I know that Atom should be quite powerful but as you I haven't tried it yet.

> 
I have been busy lately, but will try a bit more later on and let you know if I discover anything!

10/17/2017 11:50 PM

 **sydneyneurotechx** :

 >Hey ryanlintott Sorry for the delay. Came back from Vacation today.

10/17/2017 11:51 PM

 **sydneyneurotechx** :

 >I'm not sure. I'll take a look at it today

10/17/2017 11:54 PM

 **sydneyneurotechx** :

 >Hey ryanlintott I'm not sure what we could do.

10/17/2017 11:54 PM

 **sydneyneurotechx** :

 >I double checked myself

10/17/2017 11:55 PM

 **sydneyneurotechx** :

 >I think we will need to just find a replacement

10/17/2017 11:55 PM

 **sydneyneurotechx** :

 >I'll ask Dawn (The person who made the content) and see if she can provide access

10/18/2017 2:34 PM

 **francescacoo** :

 >Hi everyone, I will join the call tonight but I am sorry to say that I didn't have time to write anything.. I searched for sources though so I should update ethics shortly. First two weeks of november I will be on holidays as well.. but I guess we will talk about the next deadlines on the call! (I got in contact with vasilisa as well, she can help but unable to join the call because of the timezone, so I will bring some questions she asked me!)

10/18/2017 2:55 PM

 **ryanlintott** :

 >Thanks!

10/18/2017 7:10 PM

 **jfrayshe** :

 >Apologies to the group, I will likely be missing the call tonight due to a last minute work meeting. For the group I will post the following updates: *Neural Oscillations*: Double checked formatting, will be creating a local build of Jekyll to figure out the source of errors on the formatting (mostly just looked at preprocessing to see what they did that worked so well). *ERP* Brought some more of the content over to the github page, I will be bringing the rest over throughout the week.

10/18/2017 7:10 PM

 **jfrayshe** :

 >Bonus: If anyone has successfully gotten .gifs to load in markdown let me know! Mine have consistently failed.

 **francescacoo** :

 >unfortunately I won't be available from the 1st to the 10th of November :disappointed:

10/24/2017 3:46 PM

 **ryanlintott** :

 >Sorry but somehow Ive broken the bottom half of the Intro to Neuroscience page. It works when I do a local build with jekyll but when I push it to git the page only loads to the brain and spine line. Theres really nothing interesting happening at that part of the file and I cant figure out why the page isnt building correctly. Is there a jekyll guru that might be able to have a look?

10/25/2017 10:03 AM

 **francescacoo** :

 >yep it looks like after the brain and spine it closes the &lt;/div&gt; ... no idea why.. I am no expert but I'll try to have a look

10/25/2017 4:11 PM

 **ryanlintott** :

 >Fixed! I put the old links into comments with &lt;!-- --&gt; but I had them spanning over multiple lines. For some reason this builds correctly on my local jekyll but not on github. It looks like github was probably reading the &lt;/p&gt; tags inside those comments and closing many of the paragraphs too early. This then led to the truncation. Anyways, its all fixed now. :slightly_smiling_face:

10/25/2017 4:18 PM

 **francescacoo** :

 >Ah very good! I was trying to understand where it was coming from! Good you solved
