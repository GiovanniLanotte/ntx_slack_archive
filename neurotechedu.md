 >Hey all! Send you all the details soon!

 **sydneyneurotechx** :

 >Hey <!channel>  I've sent out the email with the confirmed content you will be working on. Please fill out the next doodle as soon as you can.

 **sydneyneurotechx** :

 ><!channel>  hey y'all! Everything is good to go for the first set of meetings this week. Looking forward to moving this forward and creating open content!

 >Hey sam_gregz  and francescacoo  I forgot to mention that the way I'd like to manage of the Project management is through Trello. You can get the link to the Google Drive through that

 >If you can sign up, this way it would be easier to manage

4/4/2017 6:39 PM

 **francescacoo** :

 >done!

 **sydneyneurotechx** :

 >Hey everyone. For those who haven't joined the trello board, please use this link to do so

 **francescacoo** :

 >Hi everybody, here I am starting with the questions about building content... sorry if they are basic... 

> 
I have access to online libraries through my university, so I was reading an article on the IEEE digital library. If I want to add a picture found in the article, can I do it? Of course referencing it correctly. I know I can for my university assignments, but I am not really sure about this case. Thanks a lot!

 **sydneyneurotechx** :

 >hmm unsure davidevaleriani alexandre.barachant  sheida hectordomorozco  Any ideas?

4/6/2017 2:38 AM

 **sheida** :

 >francescacoo yes I don't see any issue as long as you are referencing it, once it's published it is meant for the public to see! 

4/6/2017 10:06 AM

 **davidevaleriani** :

 >mmmh not necessarily, it depends on the copyright, sometimes (like in the case of IEEE) you have to request a permission for that. Have a look here <https://www.ieee.org/publications_standards/publications/rights/reqperm.html>

4/6/2017 10:55 AM

 **francescacoo** :

 >thank you! So I guess that each journal has its own rules.. I will check that next time :wink:

4/6/2017 12:55 PM

 **sydneyneurotechx** :

 >If you need any help on getting permission francescacoo  let me know !

4/6/2017 4:21 PM

 **francescacoo** :

 >I tried through the link davidevaleriani posted and it came up a price of 225.00 USD :scream: I guess it's not that important to use that picture :stuck_out_tongue: but good to know how it works! Hopefully I can just cite the journal without using images or copying their text! I will try to learn more about copyrights while writing the content!

> 
sheida I believe the difference is because this is a published journal / paper so not available for the public?

4/6/2017 4:22 PM

 **davidevaleriani** :

 >An alternative would be to contact the author, ask for his/her permission and then slightly change the figure

4/6/2017 4:25 PM

 **davidevaleriani** :

 >It gives me $125 if I ask to reuse a picture of one of my papers :expressionless:

4/6/2017 4:33 PM

 **sydneyneurotechx** :

 >Doesn't the Author of the paper also manage it's rights davidevaleriani ? If you get the authors permission, couldn't they give access for free?

4/6/2017 4:33 PM

 **davidevaleriani** :

 >Not with IEEE, you give rights to them when you publish the paper (that's why you sign the copyright form).

4/6/2017 4:35 PM

 **sydneyneurotechx** :

 >Lame

4/6/2017 4:39 PM

 **yrenard** :

 >guys, you can share the draft with anyone

4/6/2017 4:57 PM

 **sydneyneurotechx** :

 >The draft of the paper? It doesn't fall under the copyright of IEEE?

4/6/2017 4:58 PM

 **davidevaleriani** :

 >No, only the final version, but usually you don't change the figures from the draft to the final version

4/6/2017 4:58 PM

 **davidevaleriani** :

 >I mean, I wouldn't risk, especially if we are aiming at large audience. Then, the PDFs of all my papers are freely available on my website :stuck_out_tongue:

 **sheida** :

 >francescacoo davidevaleriani thanks for double checking! I assumed you only need permission if you want to re-publish a figure (eg in a book) but I suppose this may fall under the same category. Might be worth asking the editors for future ref

 >Hey guys, my Neurotech class is starting to wrap up, and I'd like to merge it with the materials from neurotechedu and create a little Intro to Neurotech MOOC

 >The materials developed are here

 **pierre** :

 >The most interesting are the python labs, which are ~2 hours experiments that people do with ganglions

4/11/2017 4:36 AM

 **pierre** :

 >most of the labs can be adapted for Muse with just a change in the data stream to LSL

4/11/2017 4:38 AM

 **pierre** :

 >I'm lacking in more detailed text/video explanations, and more friendly troubleshooting instructions

4/11/2017 4:38 AM

 **pierre** :

 >From looking at the trello board, it seems like you're on your way to creating these explanations

4/11/2017 5:03 AM

 **sydneyneurotechx** :

 >Hey Pierre. Can we jump into a call?

4/11/2017 5:04 AM

 **sydneyneurotechx** :

 >Would like to discuss how we can merge this together

4/11/2017 5:04 AM

 **pierre** :

 >Hey sydneyneurotechx, I can't right now, but I'll DM you to set a time

4/11/2017 6:31 PM

 **sydneyneurotechx** :

 >hey <!channel> How's everyone doing with the Modules? Any Questions? Concerns? What can I do to help?

4/12/2017 11:08 AM

 **davidevaleriani** :

 >Hey everyone, this is a very good introductory tutorial to python for data analysis, I think it is worth to include it somewhere on EDU. <https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/exploratory-data-analysis-python>

4/12/2017 5:24 PM

 **sydneyneurotechx** :

 >very cool.

4/12/2017 5:24 PM

 **sydneyneurotechx** :

 >Also ch.yumin davidevaleriani  had a conversation about which version of python to use and I had suggest 3.3 as 2.7 won't be supported by 2020. Anyone disagree?

4/12/2017 5:29 PM

 **pierre** :

 >I agree that you should use Python 3. If you're at all unsure, it's not too hard to write code that's backwards compatible with python 2 as well
