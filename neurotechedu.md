 >Hey <!channel>  I've sent out the email with the confirmed content you will be working on. Please fill out the next doodle as soon as you can.

 **sydneyneurotechx** :

 ><!channel>  hey y'all! Everything is good to go for the first set of meetings this week. Looking forward to moving this forward and creating open content!

 >Hey sam_gregz  and francescacoo  I forgot to mention that the way I'd like to manage of the Project management is through Trello. You can get the link to the Google Drive through that

 **sydneyneurotechx** :

 >Hey everyone. For those who haven't joined the trello board, please use this link to do so

 **francescacoo** :

 >Hi everybody, here I am starting with the questions about building content... sorry if they are basic... 

> 
I have access to online libraries through my university, so I was reading an article on the IEEE digital library. If I want to add a picture found in the article, can I do it? Of course referencing it correctly. I know I can for my university assignments, but I am not really sure about this case. Thanks a lot!

4/6/2017 1:28 AM

 **sydneyneurotechx** :

 >hmm unsure davidevaleriani alexandre.barachant  sheida hectordomorozco  Any ideas?

4/6/2017 2:38 AM

 **sheida** :

 >francescacoo yes I don't see any issue as long as you are referencing it, once it's published it is meant for the public to see! 

4/6/2017 10:06 AM

 **davidevaleriani** :

 >mmmh not necessarily, it depends on the copyright, sometimes (like in the case of IEEE) you have to request a permission for that. Have a look here <https://www.ieee.org/publications_standards/publications/rights/reqperm.html>

4/6/2017 10:55 AM

 **francescacoo** :

 >thank you! So I guess that each journal has its own rules.. I will check that next time :wink:

4/6/2017 12:55 PM

 **sydneyneurotechx** :

 >If you need any help on getting permission francescacoo  let me know !

4/6/2017 4:21 PM

 **francescacoo** :

 >I tried through the link davidevaleriani posted and it came up a price of 225.00 USD :scream: I guess it's not that important to use that picture :stuck_out_tongue: but good to know how it works! Hopefully I can just cite the journal without using images or copying their text! I will try to learn more about copyrights while writing the content!

> 
sheida I believe the difference is because this is a published journal / paper so not available for the public?

4/6/2017 4:22 PM

 **davidevaleriani** :

 >An alternative would be to contact the author, ask for his/her permission and then slightly change the figure

4/6/2017 4:25 PM

 **davidevaleriani** :

 >It gives me $125 if I ask to reuse a picture of one of my papers :expressionless:

4/6/2017 4:33 PM

 **sydneyneurotechx** :

 >Doesn't the Author of the paper also manage it's rights davidevaleriani ? If you get the authors permission, couldn't they give access for free?

4/6/2017 4:33 PM

 **davidevaleriani** :

 >Not with IEEE, you give rights to them when you publish the paper (that's why you sign the copyright form).

4/6/2017 4:35 PM

 **sydneyneurotechx** :

 >Lame

4/6/2017 4:39 PM

 **yrenard** :

 >guys, you can share the draft with anyone

4/6/2017 4:57 PM

 **sydneyneurotechx** :

 >The draft of the paper? It doesn't fall under the copyright of IEEE?

4/6/2017 4:58 PM

 **davidevaleriani** :

 >No, only the final version, but usually you don't change the figures from the draft to the final version

4/6/2017 4:58 PM

 **davidevaleriani** :

 >I mean, I wouldn't risk, especially if we are aiming at large audience. Then, the PDFs of all my papers are freely available on my website :stuck_out_tongue:

 **sheida** :

 >francescacoo davidevaleriani thanks for double checking! I assumed you only need permission if you want to re-publish a figure (eg in a book) but I suppose this may fall under the same category. Might be worth asking the editors for future ref

 **pierre** :

 >Hey guys, my Neurotech class is starting to wrap up, and I'd like to merge it with the materials from neurotechedu and create a little Intro to Neurotech MOOC

 >The materials developed are here

 **pierre** :

 >The most interesting are the python labs, which are ~2 hours experiments that people do with ganglions

4/11/2017 4:36 AM

 **pierre** :

 >most of the labs can be adapted for Muse with just a change in the data stream to LSL

4/11/2017 4:38 AM

 **pierre** :

 >I'm lacking in more detailed text/video explanations, and more friendly troubleshooting instructions

4/11/2017 4:38 AM

 **pierre** :

 >From looking at the trello board, it seems like you're on your way to creating these explanations

4/11/2017 5:03 AM

 **sydneyneurotechx** :

 >Hey Pierre. Can we jump into a call?

4/11/2017 5:04 AM

 **sydneyneurotechx** :

 >Would like to discuss how we can merge this together

4/11/2017 5:04 AM

 **pierre** :

 >Hey sydneyneurotechx, I can't right now, but I'll DM you to set a time

4/11/2017 6:31 PM

 **sydneyneurotechx** :

 >hey <!channel> How's everyone doing with the Modules? Any Questions? Concerns? What can I do to help?

4/12/2017 11:08 AM

 **davidevaleriani** :

 >Hey everyone, this is a very good introductory tutorial to python for data analysis, I think it is worth to include it somewhere on EDU. <https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/exploratory-data-analysis-python>

4/12/2017 5:24 PM

 **sydneyneurotechx** :

 >very cool.

4/12/2017 5:24 PM

 **sydneyneurotechx** :

 >Also ch.yumin davidevaleriani  had a conversation about which version of python to use and I had suggest 3.3 as 2.7 won't be supported by 2020. Anyone disagree?

4/12/2017 5:29 PM

 **pierre** :

 >I agree that you should use Python 3. If you're at all unsure, it's not too hard to write code that's backwards compatible with python 2 as well

4/12/2017 5:37 PM

 **davidevaleriani** :

 >Also, scripts written in Python 2 could be easily converted into Python 3 with the 2to3 program <https://docs.python.org/2/library/2to3.html>

4/12/2017 5:38 PM

 **davidevaleriani** :

 >(and there is also a 3to2 package <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/3to2>)

4/12/2017 5:38 PM

 **yrenard** :

 >Just mind the `if a syntactical conversion is possible`

4/12/2017 5:40 PM

 **yrenard** :

 >For instance the division `/` in python 2 results in integers division if both operands are integers - In python 3, this is a floating point division and you should use the '//' operator if you ever wanted to do an integer division (the rounding still is different but who cares at this point)

4/12/2017 5:40 PM

 **yrenard** :

 >This sums up to the fact that Python 2 and Python 3 are two different languages with a very similar set of features and syntax similarities

4/12/2017 5:57 PM

 **ch.yumin** :

 >Hmm, I'm going to use python3 than

4/12/2017 5:57 PM

 **ch.yumin** :

 >Thanks guys :smile:

 **francescacoo** :

 >Hi guys, I was wondering if you have maybe access to more databases than me for full text articles? I do have access to some of them through my university library, but it looks like I can't download some articles. In case I need can I ask here? (ok, not that I am doing anything special, just the intro, but reading a lot helps me :slightly_smiling_face: )

4/12/2017 9:56 PM

 **davidevaleriani** :

 >What about <http://sci-hub.cc|sci-hub.cc>? 

4/13/2017 1:23 AM

 **vasilisa** :

 >Hi, francescacoo . I have access to all big databases trough my university. Feel free to ask me :)

 >i will have a look i didn't know it thanks

4/13/2017 7:10 AM

 **francescacoo** :

 >davidevaleriani: i will have a look i didn't know it thanks!

4/13/2017 7:11 AM

 **francescacoo** :

 >vasilisa: great thank you!

4/14/2017 5:02 PM

 **ch.yumin** :

 >hey guys, can someone help me? What exactly is 'epoch' or 'epoching' in BCIs? From my first researches, i think that it's the signal after the preprocessing. But i'm not sure about this

4/14/2017 5:34 PM

 **davidevaleriani** :

 >Hey ch.yumin, an epoch is generally a chunk of EEG recording (usually after preprocessing, yes). The most used type of epoch is the stimulus-locked, which means that we consider 0 the onset of the stimulus and then we extract the first N milliseconds after that. So, if N is 1500, we are sampling at 32 Hz and we have 100 stimuli, we will have 100 signals of 48 samples (1.5s * 32) for each electrode, so 100 epochs of 48 samples per electrode.

4/14/2017 5:38 PM

 **ch.yumin** :

 >Wow, nice explantion! Thank you

4/20/2017 7:39 PM

 **sydneyneurotechx** :

 >Hey <!channel> . dawnkolpin  Has built her first draft of the intro to Neuroscience Lesson for NeuroTechEDU and is looking for some feedback on the structure of the content.  She's also curious to know if she is going in the right direction as well.  Could some of the Neuro experts take a look at it? :slightly_smiling_face:. dawnkolpin  Anything else you would like feedback on?
