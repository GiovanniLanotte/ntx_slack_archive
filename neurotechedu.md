 **francescacoo** :

 >Hi everybody, here I am starting with the questions about building content... sorry if they are basic... 

> 
I have access to online libraries through my university, so I was reading an article on the IEEE digital library. If I want to add a picture found in the article, can I do it? Of course referencing it correctly. I know I can for my university assignments, but I am not really sure about this case. Thanks a lot!

4/6/2017 1:28 AM

 **sydneyneurotechx** :

 >hmm unsure davidevaleriani alexandre.barachant  sheida hectordomorozco  Any ideas?

4/6/2017 2:38 AM

 **sheida** :

 >francescacoo yes I don't see any issue as long as you are referencing it, once it's published it is meant for the public to see! 

4/6/2017 10:06 AM

 **davidevaleriani** :

 >mmmh not necessarily, it depends on the copyright, sometimes (like in the case of IEEE) you have to request a permission for that. Have a look here <https://www.ieee.org/publications_standards/publications/rights/reqperm.html>

4/6/2017 10:55 AM

 **francescacoo** :

 >thank you! So I guess that each journal has its own rules.. I will check that next time :wink:

4/6/2017 12:55 PM

 **sydneyneurotechx** :

 >If you need any help on getting permission francescacoo  let me know !

4/6/2017 4:21 PM

 **francescacoo** :

 >I tried through the link davidevaleriani posted and it came up a price of 225.00 USD :scream: I guess it's not that important to use that picture :stuck_out_tongue: but good to know how it works! Hopefully I can just cite the journal without using images or copying their text! I will try to learn more about copyrights while writing the content!

> 
sheida I believe the difference is because this is a published journal / paper so not available for the public?

4/6/2017 4:22 PM

 **davidevaleriani** :

 >An alternative would be to contact the author, ask for his/her permission and then slightly change the figure

4/6/2017 4:25 PM

 **davidevaleriani** :

 >It gives me $125 if I ask to reuse a picture of one of my papers :expressionless:

4/6/2017 4:33 PM

 **sydneyneurotechx** :

 >Doesn't the Author of the paper also manage it's rights davidevaleriani ? If you get the authors permission, couldn't they give access for free?

4/6/2017 4:33 PM

 **davidevaleriani** :

 >Not with IEEE, you give rights to them when you publish the paper (that's why you sign the copyright form).

4/6/2017 4:58 PM

4/12/2017 5:29 PM

 **pierre** :

 >I agree that you should use Python 3. If you're at all unsure, it's not too hard to write code that's backwards compatible with python 2 as well

4/12/2017 5:37 PM

 **davidevaleriani** :

 >Also, scripts written in Python 2 could be easily converted into Python 3 with the 2to3 program <https://docs.python.org/2/library/2to3.html>

4/12/2017 5:38 PM

 **davidevaleriani** :

 >(and there is also a 3to2 package <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/3to2>)

4/12/2017 5:38 PM

 **yrenard** :

 >Just mind the `if a syntactical conversion is possible`

4/12/2017 5:40 PM

 **yrenard** :

 >For instance the division `/` in python 2 results in integers division if both operands are integers - In python 3, this is a floating point division and you should use the '//' operator if you ever wanted to do an integer division (the rounding still is different but who cares at this point)

4/12/2017 5:40 PM

 **yrenard** :

 >This sums up to the fact that Python 2 and Python 3 are two different languages with a very similar set of features and syntax similarities

4/12/2017 5:57 PM

 **ch.yumin** :

 >hey guys, can someone help me? What exactly is 'epoch' or 'epoching' in BCIs? From my first researches, i think that it's the signal after the preprocessing. But i'm not sure about this

4/14/2017 5:34 PM

 **davidevaleriani** :

 >Hey ch.yumin, an epoch is generally a chunk of EEG recording (usually after preprocessing, yes). The most used type of epoch is the stimulus-locked, which means that we consider 0 the onset of the stimulus and then we extract the first N milliseconds after that. So, if N is 1500, we are sampling at 32 Hz and we have 100 stimuli, we will have 100 signals of 48 samples (1.5s * 32) for each electrode, so 100 epochs of 48 samples per electrode.

 >sydneyneurotechx So, I just finished going through the draft of intro to Neuroscience. I commented some stuff around. I think that my main concern is that these is not really Intro to Neuroscience, but it almost has the contents of at least 3 or 4 different courses on Neuroscience. I feel that some of this information is not really necessary for a person that wants to go into NeuroTech (For instance, the historical evolution of Neuroscience).

I also think you guys should check out the Medical Neuroscience Course from Duke University. It has a very nice outline and it actually has materials on almost all the things you want to cover (they dont talk at all about EEG-MEG-FMRI&).
