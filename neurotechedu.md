 >Hi everybody, here I am starting with the questions about building content... sorry if they are basic... 

> 
I have access to online libraries through my university, so I was reading an article on the IEEE digital library. If I want to add a picture found in the article, can I do it? Of course referencing it correctly. I know I can for my university assignments, but I am not really sure about this case. Thanks a lot!

 >hmm unsure davidevaleriani alexandre.barachant  sheida hectordomorozco  Any ideas?

 **sheida** :

 >francescacoo yes I don't see any issue as long as you are referencing it, once it's published it is meant for the public to see!

 **davidevaleriani** :

 >mmmh not necessarily, it depends on the copyright, sometimes (like in the case of IEEE) you have to request a permission for that. Have a look here <https://www.ieee.org/publications_standards/publications/rights/reqperm.html>

 **francescacoo** :

 >thank you! So I guess that each journal has its own rules.. I will check that next time :wink:

 **sydneyneurotechx** :

 >If you need any help on getting permission francescacoo  let me know !

 **francescacoo** :

 >I tried through the link davidevaleriani posted and it came up a price of 225.00 USD :scream: I guess it's not that important to use that picture :stuck_out_tongue: but good to know how it works! Hopefully I can just cite the journal without using images or copying their text! I will try to learn more about copyrights while writing the content!

> 
sheida I believe the difference is because this is a published journal / paper so not available for the public?

 **davidevaleriani** :

 >An alternative would be to contact the author, ask for his/her permission and then slightly change the figure

 >It gives me $125 if I ask to reuse a picture of one of my papers :expressionless:
