 **harris** :

 >[Looking for internship] Hello everyone. My name is Harris R. I'm currently a senior in high school and will be attending university in the fall. I will be majoring in computer science with a focus on artificial intelligence, machine learning, and big data.  I am extremely interested in neuroscience/brain computer interfaces (I've spent the past 2 years trying to learn as much as I could) and I am hoping to see if I can intern at a company in the field to gain real world experience. I currently live in the Atlanta, GA area (could potentially relocate for the job) and anyone knew of a company or program which I could apply to.

Elon, on the other hand, as a longer target of something like a 9 year for a first implanted device. IMO, it's too short, they will get slowed down like hell by regulatory issues. but he might manage to keep it afloat long enough so that we can something going out of it

My guess is he wants someone to keep up his LinkedIn content but ask him.
