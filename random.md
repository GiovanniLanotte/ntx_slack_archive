 >using error potentials for external control is a really cool BCI paradigm. like alexandre mentioned, one paradigm is that the BCI guesses randomly, and then the error potential acts as a "critic" of the BCI's.  things get really interesting when the BCI uses a learning paradigm, like reinforcement learning / q-learning, to start to figure out which state-action pairs cause error, and eventually converges to adopt the state-action sequence that minimizes these evoked error potentials.

Just because something is an ethical issue does not make ethics black and white. Maybe you have a different definition of ethical issue than I do - for me it means that something that needs to be discussed and pro and cons need be weighed up thoroughly and discussing the consequences before going through with it, not just doing it because it might work and sounds like a good idea.

6/8/2017 8:06 AM

 **mhough** :

 >sid_fulminds rgbn alexandre.barachant ok I see you already responded to this. I posted in devices. Can we just have some boilerplate response for all these that we can just point people to. Yeah I think it should have something about how people who buy it will potentially be some of its most vocal advocates and psychologically why. Not just placebo effects but social psychological and other known mechanisms such as lack of proper metrics and economists understanding of human's temporal blinders. With great claims comes the need for overwhelming evidence not scant. These toy sport devices are not my concern really, I think a prototype, if you will:), of what I am talking about are the binaural, audio-visual and somatosensory devices that are WIDELY used in a number of chronic pain disorders, clinical disorders with no recognized effective treatment and actually RECOMMENDED by PTSD/trauma therapists for whatever you want to call their pain. These people are in a risk category for suicide which is you know sometimes fatal. If you follow me on LinkedIn, you can see that following the temporal interference TES device manufacturer around he seems to be quite cozy with such peddlers. Again, not really my focus, my target being the Amen Clinics as respectable medical facilities, but I want to know how best to respond. Electricity is not a new therapy. It has been used as such almost as soon as Galvani made a frog's leg move. Historically it has been used whenever there is a lack of recognized treatment but it is especially known for treating "diagnoses" that were socially or culturally motivated such as shocking women who were infertile or in the case of my grandmother probably because she was talking just a little too much sense.

6/8/2017 9:43 PM

 **sid_fulminds** :

 >mhough thanks for sharing! Although in all honesty, I am not sure I understand your point though. Are you saying that in general there is a need to provide hard evidence to healthcare claims that are often much too lightly substantiated ?

6/8/2017 10:46 PM

 **mhough** :

 >sid_fulminds yes. yes there should be. And not just electrical. I thought that was understood after the Lumosity case. In the cases that are remanded to therapy because no treatment alternatives are available, the same exact rules should apply. That is where the widespread abuse of these treatments takes place in my opinion. Hope that helps

6/8/2017 11:54 PM

 **mhough** :

 >Here is a copy of what a device manufacturer would like to say constitutes evidence of claims. It was shared publicly on LinkedIn so I feel comfortable posting this. The discussion arose regarding Lymes disease but the manufacturer claims many other disorders can be similarly treated. Lastly before I post this, think about what a device should be shown to do to be an effective treatment for say Lymes  disease.
