 >:slightly_smiling_face: , that's what i call (personnaly) a frustration-based BCI. you make random guess and probe for error potential. If present you choose the oposite action, if not you continue :slightly_smiling_face:

sometimes, error potential are easier to detect than the actual command, so you don't tell the user but you just give him random feedback and probe for error.

 **gabe.ibagon** :

 >using error potentials for external control is a really cool BCI paradigm. like alexandre mentioned, one paradigm is that the BCI guesses randomly, and then the error potential acts as a "critic" of the BCI's.  things get really interesting when the BCI uses a learning paradigm, like reinforcement learning / q-learning, to start to figure out which state-action pairs cause error, and eventually converges to adopt the state-action sequence that minimizes these evoked error potentials.
