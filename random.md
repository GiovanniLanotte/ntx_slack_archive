 >using error potentials for external control is a really cool BCI paradigm. like alexandre mentioned, one paradigm is that the BCI guesses randomly, and then the error potential acts as a "critic" of the BCI's.  things get really interesting when the BCI uses a learning paradigm, like reinforcement learning / q-learning, to start to figure out which state-action pairs cause error, and eventually converges to adopt the state-action sequence that minimizes these evoked error potentials.

Just because something is an ethical issue does not make ethics black and white. Maybe you have a different definition of ethical issue than I do - for me it means that something that needs to be discussed and pro and cons need be weighed up thoroughly and discussing the consequences before going through with it, not just doing it because it might work and sounds like a good idea.

I think the most useful part of a book like that would be the table of contents: look for 2, maybe 3 topics that really intrigue you, then read some surveys of those three topics, and then dig into one in gory detail.
