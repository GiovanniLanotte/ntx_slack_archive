The Student Clubs committee is looking for someone to help us develop a website for the Student Clubs initiative. The website will be cool and good-looking, including lots of ressources for new, future and established student clubs, obviously open-source, and probably developed using Jekyll (or similar framework) on GitHub. If you know someone that would be interested in helping us, please contact me (<mailto:benjamindeleener@neurotechx.com|benjamindeleener@neurotechx.com>).
