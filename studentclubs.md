 ><!channel> We need help!

> 
The Student Clubs committee is looking for someone to help us develop a website for the Student Clubs initiative. The website will be cool and good-looking, including lots of ressources for new, future and established student clubs, obviously open-source, and probably developed using Jekyll (or similar framework) on GitHub. If you know someone that would be interested in helping us, please contact me (<mailto:benjamindeleener@neurotechx.com|benjamindeleener@neurotechx.com>).

 ><@U090L60LE> could probably have someone in our dev shop (www.ae.studio) make a good-looking site for free pretty easily

 >Hi! Does anyone here know which companies are more likely to send student clubs sample products to demo and expose studnets to what is out there

 >Muse, Neurosky and OpenBCI have always been very nice about doing that. If you are looking for TDCS <http://Foc.us|Foc.us> have been helpful.

 >Hi Sabrina, My company - Neuro Device is very open to support a students. We provide stimulators for fMRI (tactile and olfactometer), but very soon we will announce two new products - transcranial electro stimulator (with much more modulations as are offered currently) and GSR/Pulse wearable bracelet. If you are interested in, please send me direct message. We have also our lab, where you can use EEGs, eyetrackers, face-recording, psychophysiology apparatus. Unfortunately lab is located in Warsaw, Poland...

 >Hi Pawel, Do you have a website? Would love to learn more abou tit.

 **hectordomorozco** :

 >Beautiful NTX people, quick question: If you were budgeting a webpage for a student club (nothing too fancy, nothing too big)... How much money would you allocate to this?

3/23/2017 6:27 PM

 **yannick** :

 >You shouldn't pay for it, students should do it. The easiest way is to fork the NeuroTechUofT one on GitHub (Jekyll based). Indiana University is currently doing their website as well based on that approach. We'd like to make a "Template out of it". Thumbs up to NeuroTechUofT! Now we can copy their website and improve on it and provide a nice template to new student clubs!

 >Braden is currently spearheading the Indiana University NeuroTech Student Club.

And Sayan as we all know, with his awesome team, is behind NeuroTechUofT.

 **yannick** :

 >hectordomorozco do not hesitate to contact them to get the McMaster one online :smile:

3/23/2017 6:51 PM

 **sayan_faraz** :

 >yannick ours isn't jekyll based yet :stuck_out_tongue: (we've been just hard-coding our blog posts :cry: ... yes i know very hacky .-.) but we're going to make it jekyll-based very soon

> 


> 
but yeah you definitely don't need to pay for it; we just recruited students who were interested in learning web development and gave them an awesome project to work on :smile:

> 


> 
and hectordomorozco definitely feel free to contact me if you need anything :smile:

3/23/2017 6:52 PM

 **sayan_faraz** :

 >also yannick is this the official channel for student clubs now (ie are we stopping the use of the nt-studentclubs slack?

3/23/2017 8:46 PM

 **yannick** :

 >sayan_faraz Ho! Really! By the look of it, I thought it was.

 **yannick** :

 >As for the Student Club Slack, I'd come back here, until too much is happening and we really need subsections for specific conversations. benjamindeleener, your thoughts?

3/24/2017 12:42 AM

 **benjamindeleener** :

 >sayan_faraz yannick indeed this channel is a little bit more used that a whole studentclubs slack domain. And I guess it is enough for small conversations during the year. Although, we could keep the studentclubs domain for the competition, or create a specific channel on this one.

 **braden** :

 >I was planning on getting a website together this weekend, so perhaps it would be more efficient to start something on wordpress since Im more familiar? Im willing to help with this process, hectordomorozco.

3/24/2017 5:42 AM

 **braden** :

 >any thoughts? yannick benjamindeleener

3/24/2017 5:45 AM

 **braden** :

 >Also just as a quick update on the status of moving parts here at IU, so far Ive found 4 other students that want to be engaged with neurotech.

3/24/2017 5:51 AM

 **braden** :

 >I also met with the hacker squad within our psych department today, theyre going to let me use a mini race track controlled by neurosky as a tangible promotional example rather than trying to inspire others through only a slide deck

3/24/2017 5:52 AM

 **braden** :

 >Any suggestions on getting faculty support though?

3/24/2017 5:54 AM

 **braden** :

 >I met with the psych departments director of outreach today, and he thought it might be difficult to get most of our professors to understand the value in what were trying to do

3/24/2017 5:55 AM

 **braden** :

 >My first thought was to make some sort of video or podcast portraying testimonials from undergrads or professors from other universities

3/24/2017 5:55 AM

 **sayan_faraz** :

 >braden our approach so far has been not to approach faculty until we have something that they can contribute to; or else they end up sitting around not really knowing how to contribute

> 
but on the other hand they can really give helpful tips that would save lots of time and worrying

3/24/2017 5:57 AM

 **sayan_faraz** :

 >but again a lot of this is 'trial and error' like in startups, so not completely sure if our approach has been a good one :stuck_out_tongue:

> 
i'll definitely say it has its pros and cons

3/24/2017 5:57 AM

 **sayan_faraz** :

 >we've tried asking grad students and postdocs instead; one of them really saved us with a few projects

3/24/2017 6:05 AM

 **braden** :

 >yes that makes complete sense. I have some experience working with an awesome faculty member whose support would be super helpful, but its been a couple days with no response. Im sure it would be helpful if we were able to show him that were serious through some tangible project we did

3/24/2017 6:07 AM

 **braden** :

 >good to hear that youve found grad/post doc support though, that is definitely part of my plans for next week. I have a list of EEG Labs Im going to visit next week with hopes of finding a mentor of sorts

3/24/2017 6:08 AM

 **braden** :

 >it would be great to talk to you about your past experiences with this whole process sometime, would you be willing sayan_faraz?

3/24/2017 6:11 AM

 **sayan_faraz** :

 >braden yeah ofc :smile:

> 
but i def want to stress that our way might not be the best, and other groups have probably had more success with their ways of doing things

> 
speaking of which yannick benjamindeleener should we have a meeting to discuss our approaches in running our clubs? would be an awesome way of learning from each other :stuck_out_tongue:

3/24/2017 6:18 AM

 **braden** :

 >yesss point taken. the curriculum Im currently in is strictly group projects, which has definitely shown me all varieties of successful and disastrous team dynamics. :slightly_smiling_face::upside_down_face:

3/24/2017 6:21 AM

 **braden** :

 >I do hope to connect and collaborate with student groups from other universities though, tons of value through those relationships!!

3/24/2017 6:27 AM

 **braden** :

 >If youd like to meet, heres my availability for the next week, let me know when would work best for you! <https://www.when2meet.com/?6111623-GHMGY>
