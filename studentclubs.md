The Student Clubs committee is looking for someone to help us develop a website for the Student Clubs initiative. The website will be cool and good-looking, including lots of ressources for new, future and established student clubs, obviously open-source, and probably developed using Jekyll (or similar framework) on GitHub. If you know someone that would be interested in helping us, please contact me (<mailto:benjamindeleener@neurotechx.com|benjamindeleener@neurotechx.com>).

 ><@U090L60LE> could probably have someone in our dev shop (www.ae.studio) make a good-looking site for free pretty easily

 >Hi Sabrina, My company - Neuro Device is very open to support a students. We provide stimulators for fMRI (tactile and olfactometer), but very soon we will announce two new products - transcranial electro stimulator (with much more modulations as are offered currently) and GSR/Pulse wearable bracelet. If you are interested in, please send me direct message. We have also our lab, where you can use EEGs, eyetrackers, face-recording, psychophysiology apparatus. Unfortunately lab is located in Warsaw, Poland...

 >Beautiful NTX people, quick question: If you were budgeting a webpage for a student club (nothing too fancy, nothing too big)... How much money would you allocate to this?

 >You shouldn't pay for it, students should do it. The easiest way is to fork the NeuroTechUofT one on GitHub (Jekyll based). Indiana University is currently doing their website as well based on that approach. We'd like to make a "Template out of it". Thumbs up to NeuroTechUofT! Now we can copy their website and improve on it and provide a nice template to new student clubs!
