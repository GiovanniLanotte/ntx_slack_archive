 >do you have a project that you have created which is open source and think would work well being paired with EEG? I was working on something for a conference but didn't have time to finish it

 >Would love to know if you have anything in mind that would be a good fit for BCI integration.

 **sydneyneurotechx** :

 >dano Take a look at this

4/25/2017 9:13 PM

 **sydneyneurotechx** :

 >was forked from a lab here in Montreal (Where yannick  is doing his PHD)

 >has anyone taken MRI data (DICOM NIFTI) into voxel data and put it in unity/unreal before?

 **dan** :

 >I've been putting in a lot of hours in Unity and using physical sensors like ultrasonic sound ones to manipulate virtual objects. I'm curious if we'd be able to pass in eeg waves in a similar fashion.

 **dan** :

 >Would be happy to collaborate if there's interest. My strengths are definitely more on the interaction design / VR side rather than BCI but I've been farting around with it. I think with the right team we could do some damage

7/25/2017 10:43 PM

 **dano** :

 >What could you do with a scalar variable that changed over time, corresponding roughly to the user's concentration/relaxation/etc? That's the kind of thing we're getting with Muse right now

 >Excellent

 **adamm_neurable** :

 ><!channel> Neurable is having its first public event in NYC where you can control an entire VR experience with our BCI. Real-time selections manifest in this game by allowing you to grab objects, throw them, transform lasers, teleport and more!
